<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied in software engineering to perform tasks such as translating code between programming languages, generating code from natural language, and autocompleting code as it is being written. When used within development tools, these systems typically treat each model invocation independently from all previous invocations, and only a specific limited functionality is exposed within the user interface. This approach to user interaction misses an opportunity for users to more deeply engage with the model by having the context of their previous interactions, as well as the context of their code, inform the model's responses. We developed a prototype system -the Programmer's Assistant -in order to explore the utility of conversational interactions grounded in code, as well as software engineers' receptiveness to the idea of conversing with, rather than invoking, a code-fluent LLM. Through an evaluation with 42 participants with varied levels of programming experience, we found that our system was capable of conducting extended, multi-turn discussions, and that it enabled additional knowledge and capabilities beyond code generation to emerge from the LLM. Despite skeptical initial expectations for conversational programming assistance, participants were impressed by the breadth of the assistant's capabilities, the quality of its responses, and its potential for improving their productivity. Our work demonstrates the unique potential of conversational interactions with LLMs for co-creative processes like software development.</p></div>

Collaborative software engineering is especially promising, given that professional software development is rarely a solo activity and relevant knowledge and expertise are typically distributed widely within an organization <ref type="bibr" coords="1,365.96,471.35,13.28,7.94" target="#b67">[68]</ref>. Many efforts have focused on incorporating collaborative technologies into software development environments (e.g. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,334.79,493.27,9.33,7.94" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,346.37,493.27,10.31,7.94" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,358.92,493.27,10.31,7.94" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,371.48,493.27,10.31,7.94" target="#b57">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,384.03,493.27,13.56,7.94" target="#b101">101]</ref>).</p><p>The pioneering work of Rich and Waters on The Programmer's Apprentice <ref type="bibr" coords="1,357.51,515.19,14.60,7.94" target="#b69">[70]</ref> presented a novel concept of a knowledgeable automated assistant -in effect, an artificial collaborative partner -that could help software engineers with writing code, designing software systems, and creating requirements specifications. At the time, AI technologies and computing resources were not sufficient to fully implement their vision. In the intervening years, an increase in computational power, the availability of large corpora of language and code data, and the development of deep neural networks have made new approaches to achieving their goals worth exploring.</p><p>Recently, models leveraging the transformer architecture <ref type="bibr" coords="1,543.35,613.82,14.85,7.94" target="#b95">[96]</ref> have been developed to perform domain-specific software engineering tasks, such as translating code between languages <ref type="bibr" coords="1,542.33,635.74,13.49,7.94" target="#b74">[75]</ref>, generating documentation for code <ref type="bibr" coords="1,447.43,646.70,13.43,7.94" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,463.10,646.70,10.28,7.94" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,475.62,646.70,10.28,7.94" target="#b97">97,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,488.14,646.70,10.07,7.94" target="#b98">98]</ref>, and generating unit tests for code <ref type="bibr" coords="1,385.04,657.66,14.62,7.94" target="#b91">[92]</ref> (see Talamadupula <ref type="bibr" coords="1,471.20,657.66,14.72,7.94" target="#b89">[90]</ref> and Allamanis et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,317.96,668.62,10.55,7.94" target="#b4">[5]</ref> for surveys). Recently developed foundation models -large language models that can be adapted to multiple tasks and which exhibit emergent behaviors for which they have not been explicitly trained <ref type="bibr" coords="1,360.19,701.49,14.61,7.94" target="#b13">[14]</ref> -have also proven to be capable with source code.</p><p>While the intent of training LLMs such as GPT-2 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,224.43,87.79,14.59,7.94" target="#b63">[64]</ref> and GPT-3 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,279.45,87.79,14.60,7.94" target="#b16">[17]</ref> was to give them mastery of natural language, it quickly became apparent that the presence of code in their training corpora had given them the ability to generate code based on natural language descriptions <ref type="bibr" coords="2,99.25,131.63,13.22,7.94" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. The Codex model <ref type="bibr" coords="2,182.23,131.63,14.59,7.94" target="#b23">[24]</ref> was then produced by finetuning GPT-3 on a large corpus of source code data, leading to the development of Copilot <ref type="bibr" coords="2,139.16,153.55,13.22,7.94" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, a tool that helps software engineers by autocompleting code as it is being written. Experimentation with Copilot has shown its ability to perform additional tasks, such as explaining code, generating documentation, and translating code between languages <ref type="bibr" coords="2,125.85,197.38,9.39,7.94" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>Although autocompletion interfaces are useful and valuable when the system can discern the developer's intent, there are many instances where that is insufficient. For example, the developer may have a good idea of what they want to do, but may be unclear on what functions, libraries, or even algorithms to employ. They may even have general programming questions that need to be answered before they are able to write any code.</p><p>In this paper, we seek to understand whether modern developments in code-fluent foundation models -large language models that have been fine-tuned on source code data -are sufficient to support a conversational agent that can act as an assistant in the software development process. We developed the Programmer's Assistant to explore the capabilities that conversational interaction could enable and the extent to which users would find conversational assistance with programming tasks desirable and useful.</p><p>We hypothesize that a conversational system may provide a flexible and natural means for interacting with a code-fluent LLM. Conversational interaction could enable users to pursue their questions in a multiple exchange dialog (as observed by Barke et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,53.80,416.56,13.93,7.94" target="#b12">[13]</ref>) that allows them to ask follow-up questions and refine their inquiries. A conversational programming assistant could ask the user clarifying or disambiguating questions to help it arrive at the best answer. It could also provide multiple types of assistance to the user beyond simply generating code snippets, such as engaging in general discussion of programming topics (e.g. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,234.70,471.35,13.46,7.94" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,250.40,471.35,10.62,7.94" target="#b70">71]</ref>) or helping users improve their programming skills (as observed in other studies of automating technologies <ref type="bibr" coords="2,183.87,493.27,12.91,7.94" target="#b99">[99]</ref>).</p><p>Our paper makes the following contributions to the IUI community:</p><p>• We provide empirical evidence that a conversational programming assistant based on a state-of-the-art, code-fluent foundation model provides valuable assistance to software engineers in a myriad of ways: by answering general programming questions, by generating context-relevant code, by enabling the model to exhibit emergent behaviors, and by enabling users to ask follow-up questions that depend upon their conversational and code contexts. • We show how different interaction models -conversation, direct manipulation, and search -provide complementary types of support to software engineers with tradeoffs between the user's focus and attention, the relevance of support to their code context, the provenance of that support, and their ability to ask follow-up questions.</p><p>• We motivate the need to further understand how to design human-centered AI systems that enhance the joint performance of the human-AI collaboration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>We discuss three areas of related work that have either motivated our study of conversational programming assistance or provided the technical foundations for it. We begin by briefly summarizing Rich and Waters' visionary work on the Programmer's Apprentice <ref type="bibr" coords="2,332.84,189.33,13.22,7.94" target="#b69">[70]</ref>, followed by summarizing work on code-fluent foundation models and human-centered evaluations of how these models impact software engineers' work. Finally, we discuss conversational interaction and how it might be employed to provide more flexible and sophisticated assistance to software engineers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">The Programmer's Apprentice</head><p>Our work is inspired by the vision laid out by Rich and Waters <ref type="bibr" coords="2,542.53,268.96,13.32,7.94" target="#b69">[70]</ref>, which describes an artificial agent that can act as an intelligent assistant for software engineers by providing advice, catching errors, and handling routine details throughout the software development process. The Programmer's Apprentice <ref type="bibr" coords="2,461.36,312.79,14.64,7.94" target="#b69">[70]</ref> relied on a knowledge base of "clichés," which are formal, structured versions of what are known today as software design patterns <ref type="bibr" coords="2,491.71,334.71,13.49,7.94" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. It used a hybrid reasoning system capable of special-purpose reasoning based on frames and a plan calculus, along with general purpose logical reasoning. Although natural language interaction was envisioned, the original prototype implementation ultimately used a stylized command language. We view our work as a conceptual successor to the Programmer's Apprentice, as it enables the natural language interaction that the Programmer's Apprentice lacked.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Code-fluent Foundation Models and Human-Centered Evaluations of Programming Assistance</head><p>Generative models based on the transformer architecture <ref type="bibr" coords="2,524.51,473.11,14.60,7.94" target="#b95">[96]</ref> have recently been applied to the domain of software engineering. Codefluent large language models are capable of generating code from natural language descriptions <ref type="bibr" coords="2,427.16,505.99,17.29,7.94" target="#b105">[105]</ref>, translating code from one language to another <ref type="bibr" coords="2,383.18,516.95,13.46,7.94" target="#b74">[75]</ref>, generating unit tests <ref type="bibr" coords="2,480.96,516.95,13.46,7.94" target="#b91">[92]</ref>, and even generating documentation for code <ref type="bibr" coords="2,432.91,527.91,13.60,7.94" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,449.35,527.91,10.35,7.94" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,462.55,527.91,10.35,7.94" target="#b97">97,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,475.74,527.91,10.20,7.94" target="#b98">98]</ref>. These models are probabilistic systems, and as such, do not always produce perfect results (e.g. code that is free of syntax or logical errors). Nonetheless, Weisz et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,360.74,560.78,18.89,7.94" target="#b102">[102]</ref> found that software engineers are still interested in using such models in their work, and that the imperfect outputs of these models can even help them produce higher-quality code via human-AI collaboration <ref type="bibr" coords="2,420.95,593.66,17.39,7.94" target="#b103">[103]</ref>. New tools based on code-fluent LLMs are actively being developed. GitHub Copilot<ref type="foot" coords="2,394.44,613.43,3.38,6.44" target="#foot_0">1</ref> is described as "Your AI pair programmer. " It is optimized for the code autocompletion use case: given a starting snippet such as a method's documentation, signature, or partial implementation, Copilot completes the implementation. Copilot is based on the OpenAI Codex model <ref type="bibr" coords="2,445.54,659.41,13.24,7.94" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, a 12 billion parameter version of GPT-3 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,369.71,670.37,13.43,7.94" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,385.39,670.37,10.08,7.94" target="#b48">49]</ref>, fine-tuned on code samples from 54 million public software repositories on GitHub. Empirical evaluations of this model have shown that, although the quality of its outputs is quite good, those outputs may still be problematic <ref type="bibr" coords="3,232.99,98.75,13.22,7.94" target="#b56">[57]</ref>. Echoing the results from Weisz et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,140.23,109.71,17.36,7.94" target="#b103">[103]</ref>, human-centered evaluations of Copilot have found that it increases users' feelings of productivity <ref type="bibr" coords="3,274.34,120.67,17.25,7.94" target="#b109">[109]</ref>, and that almost a third (27%) of its proposed code completions were accepted by users. In a contrasting evaluation, Vaithilingam et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,53.80,153.55,14.72,7.94" target="#b94">[95]</ref> found that while most participants expressed a preference to use Copilot in their daily work, it did not necessarily improve their task completion times or success rates. Yet, in a study by <ref type="bibr" coords="3,53.80,186.42,66.29,7.94">Kalliamvakou [40]</ref>, developers working with Copilot were able to implement a web server in Javascript 55% faster than developers who did not use Copilot.</p><p>A grounded theory analysis of how programmers interact with Copilot <ref type="bibr" coords="3,83.57,230.26,14.82,7.94" target="#b12">[13]</ref> found that their interactions varied depending upon whether they were accelerating tasks that they already knew how to do or if they were exploring solutions to problems that they were less sure about. Autocompletion was effective when developers were operating in "acceleration mode" and relied on the model to produce short completions that could be verified quickly. In "exploration mode," however, the interaction was more awkward. Developers would communicate with Copilot by typing comments and seeing what Copilot generated in response. Then, they would modify their comments to explore other ways of prompting a response. Ultimately, the comments used to prompt the model would be deleted after the relevant code was generated, indicating that their value was largely in driving a back-and-forth, yet context free, dialog with the model to coerce it to produce the desired results through an iterative refinement process. In this paper, we fully commit to a context-aware conversational style of interaction with a code-fluent LLM and assess the value it provides to users.</p></div>

They operate using pre-defined dialogue trees and use natural language processing to detect conversational intents and extract contextual entities.

Kuttal et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,230.52,617.34,14.72,7.94" target="#b41">[42]</ref> conducted a Wizard of Oz study in which a pair programmer was replaced with a conversational agent, and they found that "agents can act as effective pair programming partners." The PACT system <ref type="bibr" coords="3,259.88,650.21,19.02,7.94" target="#b106">[106]</ref> is a chatbot that assists programmers adjusting to new programming environments. PACT is structured as a discrete question-answering system based on a neural machine translation approach, but it doesn't maintain a conversational context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">Conversation Analysis.</head><p>Conversation is a form of interaction between people that enables robust communication. Conversation Analysis <ref type="bibr" coords="3,351.67,148.66,14.76,7.94" target="#b75">[76]</ref> is a method for understanding the natural structure of human conversational interaction. It catalogs different patterns of conversational acts and how they are utilized by interlocutors in order to attain a wide variety of goals. Recently, Conversation Analysis has been adapted to describe patterns of interactions between humans and artificial conversational agents in order to aid in the design of chatbots <ref type="bibr" coords="3,388.26,214.41,13.49,7.94" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. We apply techniques from Conversation Analysis in our study of conversational programming assistance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">THE PROGRAMMER'S ASSISTANT</head><p>In order to explore conversational programming assistance, we created a functional prototype system called The Programmer's Assistant. Our prototype, shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,468.51,282.75,3.01,7.94" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, combines a code editor with a chat interface. The code editor was implemented using the Microsoft Monaco Editor<ref type="foot" coords="3,413.27,302.52,3.38,6.44" target="#foot_4">5</ref> embedded in a React wrapper <ref type="foot" coords="3,534.66,302.52,3.38,6.44" target="#foot_5">6</ref> . The chat user interface was implemented using the React-Chatbot-Kit<ref type="foot" coords="3,554.49,313.48,3.38,6.44" target="#foot_6">7</ref> framework. To drive the conversational interaction, we employed OpenAI's Codex model <ref type="bibr" coords="3,405.18,337.54,13.36,7.94" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, accessed through its web API.</p><p>We developed our prototype as a lightweight coding environment in order to examine the user experience of interacting with a conversational assistant. Our work was exploratory in nature, and thus we did not have specific design goals for the prototype beyond integrating a code editor with a code-fluent LLM. We also did not attempt to target the prototype for a specific class of users (e.g. novices or experts) or use cases (e.g. writing code vs. learning a new programming language), as we wanted any value provided by conversational assistance to emerge from our user study. We also did not implement the ability to run or debug code in our prototype as we wanted to explore the nature of the conversational interaction rather than having users focus extensively on the production of working code.</p><p>When designing how users would interact with the Programmer's Assistant, we decided that it should be available on demand and not monitor the user's work in progress or give unsolicited suggestions or advice, in keeping with the conversational agent interaction model proposed by Ross et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,473.41,534.80,13.59,7.94" target="#b72">[73,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,489.24,534.80,10.19,7.94" target="#b73">74]</ref>. This approach was supported by feedback from prospective users who were concerned about the assistant providing criticism of unfinished efforts in progress or distracting them while they worked. Instead, we force initiative onto the user and only have the assistant respond to their requests. In this way, the assistant can provide help when requested without undesirable interruptions that can distract or interfere with the user's flow.</p><p>When a user interacts with the assistant, we keep track of their selection state in the code editor. If a user sends a message to the assistant without any code selected in the editor, then that message (along with the prior conversational context) is passed directly to the model. If a user sends a message to the assistant with new code selected in the editor (i.e. code that wasn't previously selected when they sent their last message), then that code is appended to the message before being communicated to the model.</p><p>The model may produce multiple types of responses to a user's message. We treat each type of response differently in the UI.</p><p>• Responses that do not contain code are always rendered in the chat UI (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,148.99,155.95,6.90,7.94" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>). • Responses containing short code snippets (≤ 10 lines) are rendered inline in the chat UI (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,216.50,177.86,7.48,7.94" target="#fig_0">1G</ref>). • Responses containing longer code snippets (&gt; 10 lines) show the code in a pop-up window (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,211.16,199.78,7.32,7.94" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>), with a proxy entry in the chat transcript (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,191.62,210.74,8.24,7.94" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>) that allows users to redisplay the code window after it has been closed. Non-code text in the response remains in the chat transcript. The assistant never directly modifies the contents of the user's source code; rather, any code the user desires to transfer from the chat takes place via copy/paste.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,89.84,278.89,4.25,7.94" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows a screenshot of a real, sample conversation, in which the user asks a question that results in an inline response, then requests an explanation of some code in the editor, and then requests further elaboration. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,174.90,311.77,4.09,7.94" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows an example conversation that resulted in the generation of a longer code sample, shown in a popup window. This example shows how the assistant produced an incomplete solution, followed by criticism from the user regarding the missing code, and resulting in an apology and the generation of a complete solution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Supporting Conversational Interaction</head><p>We enabled Codex to conduct a conversational interaction by prompting it with a conversational transcript and a request to produce the next conversational turn. The prompt establishes a pattern of conversation between a user and a programming assistant named Socrates. It provides several examples of Socrates responding to general coding questions, generating code in response to a request, and accepting code as input. It establishes a convention for delimiting code in the conversation, making it easy to parse for display in the UI. It also establishes an interaction style for the assistant, directing it to be polite, eager, helpful, and humble, and to present its responses in a non-authoritative manner <ref type="foot" coords="4,194.17,509.37,3.38,6.44" target="#foot_7">8</ref> . Because of the possibility that the model might produce erroneous answers or incorrect code (as discussed in Weisz et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,153.10,533.44,16.75,7.94" target="#b102">[102]</ref>), we felt it was important that the assistant convey a sense of uncertainty to encourage users to not accept its results uncritically to avoid over-reliance (e.g. as observed in Moroz et al.'s study of Copilot <ref type="bibr" coords="4,177.74,566.32,13.45,7.94" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, and discussed more generally in Ashktorab et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,139.54,577.28,9.92,7.94" target="#b8">[9]</ref>) as well as automation bias <ref type="bibr" coords="4,253.58,577.28,13.53,7.94" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,269.35,577.28,10.32,7.94" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,281.90,577.28,10.14,7.94" target="#b64">65]</ref>. We present the full text of the prompt used for the assistant in Appendix D.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Architecture &amp; UI Design</head><p>The Programmer's Assistant communicates with the Codex API via a proxy server that forwards requests from the React client. The proxy also rate-limits access to conform to the API's policy, and it logs UI events from the client (e.g. requests, responses, and UI interactions) in a back-end database. To address inconsistencies in the style or formatting of code generated by Codex, the proxy server reformats all code segments using the Black code formatter <ref type="foot" coords="4,317.96,118.52,3.38,6.44" target="#foot_8">9</ref> before transmitting them to the client UI.</p><p>The client maintains the transcript of the ongoing conversation. Each time the user sends a message in the chat, the client constructs a new prompt for the model by concatenating the initial prompt, the chat transcript, and the user's new utterance, and makes a request for the model to complete the transcript. This completion request also specifies a stop sequence of tokens to prevent the model from generating both sides of the conversation (e.g. what the model thinks the user's next utterance might be after the assistant's response). Given the API's limitation on context length (4,096 tokens for both the prompt and model response), we silently "forget" older exchanges in the chat transcript when constructing the prompt to ensure that our completion request remains within bounds. Nonetheless, the entire conversational history remains visible to the user in the UI.</p><p>The client UI provides a loose coupling between the source code editor and the chat interface. Users can hide the chat pane when they wish to focus solely on their code, and re-engage with it when they desire assistance. Code selected in the editor is included in the conversation in order to couple the code context with the conversation. Easily-accessible buttons are provided in the UI to copy code responses from the assistant to the clipboard.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Handling Model Limitations</head><p>While developing the Programmer's Assistant, and in early pilot testing, we experienced some quirks and shortcomings of the model and our approach to using it for conversational interaction. One limitation stemmed from the fact that the model sometimes produced incorrect responses (e.g. code with syntax errors), incomplete responses (e.g. code that was missing functionality), irrelevant responses (e.g. responses not related to the user's question), or insubstantial responses (e.g. "I don't know"). Because of the probabilistic nature of model inference, re-prompting the model would sometimes produce a more correct or appropriate response. Thus, we added the ability for users to "try again, " either by asking in the chat or by clicking a button in the UI (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,464.86,508.24,7.26,7.94" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>). This feature removes the assistant's last response from the context presented to the model and then re-invokes the model with an increased temperature <ref type="foot" coords="4,544.03,528.01,6.76,6.44" target="#foot_9">10</ref> .</p><p>Although it is possible for transformer models such as Codex to produce multiple possible responses to a single prompt, we only request a single response in order to speed up response time as well as to preserve the token budget for conversational context. Thus, the "try again" feature provides an alternate way to produce a wider variety of responses.</p><p>During pilot testing, we noticed that the assistant sometimes happened to generate the same response to multiple, unrelated requests. In these cases, the assistant tended to get "stuck" in a pattern of repeating the same response and was unable to resume normal conversation. To avoid this problem, we automatically execute a The "try again" button (C) allows users to ask the assistant to generate an alternate response to the most recent question. The "start over" button (D) resets the conversational context for the assistant, but maintains the chat transcript in the UI. In this example, we show the assistant introduce itself to the user (E). Next, the user asks a general programming question (F), for which the assistant provides an inline code response (G). The user then asks a question about code selected in the editor (H), followed by a series of follow-up questions.</p><p>"try again" operation in the background when we see identical consecutive responses from the assistant. Finally, we noticed that the accumulation of conversational context sometimes resulted in the assistant becoming fixated on some portion of the earlier conversation. For example, it might respond to a question with portions of the prompt or of earlier conversation, and become less responsive to newer requests. To address this issue, we introduced a "start over" feature, accessible via the chat or by clicking a button in the UI (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,175.86,622.95,7.40,7.94" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>), that resets the context to the original prompt, forgetting the rest of the conversational history. We preserve the chat transcript in the UI, but delineate the break in the assistant's memory with an annotation in the chat transcript. These annotations are added both for "try again" and "start over. "</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Sample Conversation</head><p>We provide a real sample conversation with the Programmer's Assistant in Listing 1. This conversation begins with the assistant greeting the user (line 1). Next, the user asks a general Python programming question (line 4), to which the assistant responds with a non-authoritative remark ("I think...") and a code snippet (line 9). The user next asks a follow-up question that depends on their previous question and the assistant's response (line 11), to which the assistant provides another code snippet (line 15), satisfying the user's request.</p><p>The user then switches topics and asks the assistant to write a Fibonacci function (line 17), and the assistant again responds with a non-authoritative remark ("I will give it a try, " line 20) and a block of code. The user then asks how the function works (line 30) and the assistant provides an adequate description (line 32). Next, the user asks the assistant to re-implement the function in a different way (line 37), again leveraging the ability to ask follow-up questions. The assistant produces an alternative implementation that conforms to the user's request (line 41). The user follows up with a question that depends on multiple past utterances and responses in the chat transcript (line 47), and the assistant produces a relevant response (line 49). The conversation closes with the user thanking the assistant (line 53) and the assistant acknowledging their gratitude (line 55).</p><p>Listing 1: A conversation with the Programmer's Assistant. Code presented by the assistant is listed in bold face. To address our questions, we deployed the Programmer's Assistant within our organization -a global technology company -and invited people to try it out and give us feedback on their experience. We invited people with varying levels of programming skill in order to obtain a wide range of feedback on the kinds of use cases for which the tool could provide assistance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Tasks</head><p>We set up the Programmer's Assistant as a playground environment that participants could try out with a few sample programming problems. We created a tutorial to orient participants to the assistant, its capabilities, and how to interact with it. We also created four programming challenges focused on writing code, documenting code, and writing tests for code. We designed these challenges to expose participants to a broad range of the assistant's capabilities. For each of these challenges, we explicitly did not evaluate metrics such as the participant's productivity, the quality of their solutions, or the time taken to produce them, as the focus of our study was to understand the utility of conversational interaction. We selected Python as the language used for the tutorial and challenges because of its general popularity <ref type="bibr" coords="7,141.04,631.87,14.59,7.94" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and the fact that it was well-supported by our underlying LLM <ref type="bibr" coords="7,141.67,642.83,13.36,7.94" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</p><p>4.1.1 Tutorial. All participants were first introduced to the Programmer's Assistant through a tutorial. The tutorial walked each participant through 10 sample interactions to give them a feeling for what the assistant could do and how to interact with it. The tutorial demonstrated how to ask questions, how to request code to be generated, and how to evaluate existing code. It did not specifically cover how to generate documentation or unit tests. Tutorial instructions were provided within the code editor. We include the specific text used for the tutorial in Appendix B.</p><p>4.1.2 Programming Challenges. After completing the tutorial, participants unlocked four programming challenges. Two of the challenges involved coding problems (writing a queue class and writing code to create a scatterplot of data in a CSV file), one involved documenting a given function (an implementation of a graph search algorithm), and one involved writing unit tests for a given function (computing the greatest common divisor of two arguments). Although the Programmer's Assistant was visible and available for use, we provided no specific requirement that it actually be used to complete the challenges.</p><p>After participants completed their solution to a challenge, they submitted it by clicking a button in the UI. The code editor used in the Programmer's Assistant was not a fully-functional IDE and did not provide syntax checking or the ability to run, test, or debug code. Due to these limitations, participants were asked to submit their solutions when they felt they had completed the challenge to their own satisfaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Participants</head><p>To recruit participants for our study, we posted internal advertisements in various communications channels focused on software engineering. Our advertisements stated that we were evaluating a conversational programming assistant, but were kept deliberately vague in order to minimize the impact on peoples' expectations of the experience.</p><p>Our advertisement yielded a pool of 140 potential participants. In order to recruit a diverse sample, we used a screening survey that asked about their job role, their familiarity with and recency of use of Python, and their availability to participate in our study. We accepted participants into the study on a rolling basis, selecting participants to capture a range of programming experiences and ensure balanced gender representation. We conducted periodic reviews to determine whether we were learning something new from each participant or if we had reached the point of saturation <ref type="bibr" coords="7,532.44,534.68,9.27,7.94" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. We stopped collecting data after running 42 participants as we were no longer observing any new behaviors or gleaning any new insights. The Programmer's Assistant implementation and configuration were held constant over the course of the study; no changes to the UI design or LLM prompt were made.</p><p>Our participants had the following self-identified characteristics: • Recency of Python Use: 29 participants had written Python code within the past month, 4 within the past year, 5 within the past 5 years, and 4 had not written Python code within the past 5 years.</p><p>We provide full demographic information for individual participants in Appendix E.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Procedure</head><p>Participants completed the study on their own time, independently and without moderation. Each participant was provided with a web link to a pre-study survey that described the nature of the study and the tasks that they would be expected to perform. They were then directed to the Programmer's Assistant to complete the tutorial and the four programming challenges. When participants indicated they were finished with the challenges <ref type="foot" coords="8,178.30,245.10,6.76,6.44" target="#foot_11">12</ref> , they were directed to a final post-study survey. Complete sessions generally required about an hour of effort, though some participants spread their effort across a longer period of time and across multiple sessions. Participants were compensated for their time at a rate equivalent to US $15/hr.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Measures</head><p>We collected a variety of data in our study from three sources:</p><p>(1) Surveys. We employed three surveys in the study: a prestudy survey to collect demographic information, a pre-task survey to gauge expectations of the conversational user experience, and a post-task survey to assess actual user experience. We describe these survey questions in the relevant context of our results, and we provide a complete listing of all survey instruments in Appendix A. (2) Event logs. The Programmer's Assistant was instrumented to collect data on participants' usage. The event logs provided timestamped records of interaction events, including conversational exchanges, hiding/showing the assistant, use of the "try again" and "start over" features, and use of copy/paste. (3) Conversation logs. From the event logs, we extracted conversational transcripts between each participant and the Programmer's Assistant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Data &amp; Analysis</head><p>We collected a wealth of data in our study: 126 survey responses from three surveys per participant, containing 296 written comments in open-ended survey questions, and 4,877 instances of 23 different types of UI events, including 1,699 conversational exchanges <ref type="foot" coords="8,82.96,598.65,6.76,6.44" target="#foot_12">13</ref> in the event logs. We also compute, for each participant, counts or durations for 21 different metrics from the event logs.</p><p>In our analysis, we deliberately exclude the portion of our data collected during the tutorial exercise. We exclude this data because that activity was guided by the tutorial instructions, not by our participants' own initiative. Thus, our final sample consists of 3,172 events, including 968 conversational exchanges in the event logs; no survey data was excluded.</p><p>Our primary analysis of this data is qualitative, as our participants provided us with a rich source of interesting feedback and thought-provoking insights in their comments. Where applicable, we supplement this data with quantitative data from the survey and the event logs, as well as chat transcript data from the conversation logs. In this way, we triangulate <ref type="bibr" coords="8,479.56,164.51,14.86,7.94" target="#b46">[47]</ref> across our three data sources, using the open-ended survey data as a foundation. When we quote participants, either from their qualitative survey responses or the conversational transcripts, we reproduce their words exactly as typed, including typos, misspellings, grammatical errors, capitalization, and potential trigger words, and we only make minor clarifying edits where needed, delineated by square brackets.</p><p>In order to set the context for our analysis, we first describe how we used reflexive thematic analysis to analyze participants' responses to the open-ended survey questions. We then describe our analysis of the conversation logs and our development of a coding guide based on Conversation Analysis <ref type="bibr" coords="8,483.62,296.01,13.23,7.94" target="#b75">[76]</ref>, and specifically, Moore and Arar's Natural Conversation Framework <ref type="bibr" coords="8,510.47,306.97,13.36,7.94" target="#b49">[50]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1">Thematic Analysis of Qualitative Survey</head><p>Responses. We conducted a reflexive thematic analysis to analyze the responses to our seven open-ended survey questions. We followed the process described by Braun and Clarke <ref type="bibr" coords="8,432.25,356.29,14.72,7.94" target="#b15">[16]</ref> in which researchers immerse themselves in the data, generate codes for material that seems interesting, and then iteratively group and refine codes through collaborative discussion in order to identify higher-level themes. Initially, four authors performed open-coding on the open-ended survey responses. Through discussion, these codes were grouped and consolidated into a single set, which were then re-applied to the data by two authors. After another round of discussion, these authors identified a set of 12 higher-level themes. Some themes had clear parallels to quantitative survey questions or event log data, and thus represented clear instances where we were able to triangulate across data sources. Other themes surprised us. We structure our presentation of the results based on these 12 themes, grouped into three different aspects of the user experience: expectations and experience, utility of conversational assistance, and patterns of interaction and mental models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2">Conversation Analysis via the Natural Conversation Framework.</head><p>In order to understand the content and structure of the conversations that took place between our participants and the Programmer's Assistant, we turned to the Natural Conversation Framework <ref type="bibr" coords="8,363.49,580.94,14.85,7.94" target="#b49">[50]</ref> (NCF). We developed a codebook for the event logs, beginning with 21 different categories of utterances from the NCF. Nine NCF categories -Acknowledgment, Apology, Confirmation, Expression of Gratitude, Farewell, Greeting, Self-Identification, Welfare Check, and Welfare Report -appeared twice in our codebook to distinguish cases in which the utterance was made by the human participant vs. the assistant. Other NCF categories were split to provide nuanced detail about the interaction; for example, we distinguished three different kinds of NCF requests, depending upon whether they were stated as Requests for Action (e.g. codes to identify meta-information such as utterances that included code, utterances that referenced selected code, utterances that implicitly or explicitly referenced earlier portions of the conversation, or non-verbal UI activities such as copies, pastes, and invocations of "try again" and "start over. " Finally, we classified a subset of the human-applied codes based on whether they represented a participant's task or social orientation toward the assistant. We list our codes in Table <ref type="table" coords="9,123.21,360.38,3.08,7.94" target="#tab_4">1</ref>, but note that not all of them ended up being relevant to our analysis. When coding conversational data, we applied individual codes at the level of each conversational utterance. We allowed multiple codes to be applied to each utterance to account for utterances that performed multiple functions (e.g. greeting and self-identification). In order to ensure consistency in how our codebook was applied, two authors coded a 10% sample of the 968 conversational exchanges, achieving a satisfactory level of inter-rater reliability (Krippendorf's 𝛼 = 0.77, where agreement was conservatively defined as having all of the same codes applied to both utterances in a conversational exchange).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Expectations and Experience</head><p>Pilot testing of the Programmer's Assistant suggested that software engineers would be skeptical of a conversational programming assistant and its ability to provide useful assistance. Our study revealed that, for most participants, their actual experience after using the tool was better than they had anticipated. Participants were surprised at the quality of the assistant's responses and they appreciated how its integration with the code editor reduced the amount of context switching they needed to do in the UI. Some participants struggled with the code selection feature, although others appreciated the ability to ask questions related to selected code.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.1">Usage.</head><p>All of our participants engaged with the Programmer's Assistant while working on the challenges, despite there being no requirement to do so. Forty-one participants submitted solutions to all four challenges, and one participant, P14, only submitted solutions for one of the four challenges. Participants spent an average of 68 minutes engaged with the assistant, as measured by the amount of time the Programmer's Assistant window was in focus.</p><p>Participants made an average of 23.0 utterances (SD = 15.1 utterances) to the assistant. On average, 6.2 of their utterances (SD = 4.3 utterances) contained a code selection. The average latency per request<ref type="foot" coords="9,344.90,336.32,6.76,6.44" target="#foot_13">14</ref> was 6.7 seconds (SD = 3.1 seconds).</p><p>We saw a 66.3% rate of acceptance of generated code, where we considered code to be accepted if the participant performed a copy immediately after the code was generated. This acceptance rate is much higher than the 27% acceptance rate reported for Copilot <ref type="bibr" coords="9,538.89,382.30,17.25,7.94" target="#b109">[109]</ref>. We believe one reason we observed a higher acceptance rate is because Copilot's completion suggestions are generated proactively, whereas the Programmer's Assistant's suggestions are generated upon request. When copying generated code from the assistant, participants most often copied the entirety of the generated code, and only in 5.8% of cases did they copy a smaller portion of it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.2">User Experience Expectations &amp; Changed Attitudes.</head><p>Prior to running our study, we had reason to believe that participants would be skeptical of a conversational programming assistant. Before developing the Programmer's Assistant, we showed potential users mockups of a program editor with an integrated chatbot feature. These prototypes elicited uniformly negative reactions. People told us about their frustrating experiences with conventional chatbots and raised doubts about the knowledge, capabilities, and value of a conversational programming assistant. This skepticism motivated us to develop the Programmer's Assistant in order to evaluate whether the conversational experience, as powered by a state-ofthe-art code-fluent LLM, would be better than people had anticipated. During pilot testing, we received feedback that the Programmer's Assistant provided a much better conversational experience compared to testers' previous experiences with chatbots. Thus, in designing our study, we felt it important to first gauge participants' expectations of a conversational interaction around code, and then measure their experience after the fact.</p><p>We developed a short inventory of six scale items to measure user experience of code work <ref type="foot" coords="10,141.49,96.60,6.76,6.44" target="#foot_14">15</ref> . The scale was administered twice: once before participants were exposed to the Programmer's Assistant (but after they had been briefed that they would interact with an AI chatbot), and once after completing the programming challenges. The items were presented with the appropriate tense: Do you expect (Did you find that) the Programmer's Assistant: (a) will be (was) easy to use; (b) will understand (understood) your requests; (c) will provide (provided) high quality responses; (d) will help (helped) you to write better code; (e) will help (helped) you to write code more quickly; (f) will be (was) enjoyable to use. Each item was rated on a 4-point scale of extent: Not at all (1), A little (2), Somewhat (3), A great deal <ref type="bibr" coords="10,100.14,219.30,8.61,7.94" target="#b3">(4)</ref>.</p><p>A factor analysis revealed the items on this scale measured a single construct, which we identify as user experience (Cronbach's 𝛼 = 0.87). Thus, we computed two scores of user experience (UX) for each participant: a pre-task UX score computed as the average of their six pre-task expectation scale responses, and a post-task UX score computed as the average of their six post-task experience scale responses.</p><p>We found that participants had lower initial expectations for their experience with a conversational programming assistant (pretask UX M (SD) = 3.0 (0.62) of 4) than their experience actually was (post-task UX M (SD) = 3.6 (0.32) of 4). A paired sample t-test shows that this difference was significant, 𝑡 (41) = 5.94, 𝑝 &lt; .001, Cohen's 𝑑 = 0.92 (large). Measured another way, 32 participants (76.2%) had post-task UX ratings that were higher than their pretask expectations, demonstrating a significant shift in attitudes toward conversational programming assistance.</p><p>However, the UX ratings alone fail to capture participants' nuanced expectations of the assistant and the reasons for their shifted attitudes after using it. Participants expressed a variety of expectations of the assistant before using it, including that it would be easy to use (P30) and produce correct responses (P30), understand the problem and what is being asked of it (P8, P9, P11), not interfere with their flow state (P5), produce imperfect or questionable outputs (P6, P21), improve with feedback (P31), provide generic and unhelpful answers (P17) or only answer basic questions (P40), and produce responses quickly (P40).</p><p>P17 expected "to be frustrated very quickly and that what I'd think would be relatively common questions would be responded to with generic, unhelpful answers." P6 explained, "I didn't have very good experiences with chatbots. I think I'll need to spend more time in reviewing and fixing the suggestions than in writing the code myself from scratch. " P11 had a more balanced view, that "It'll do some tasks really well, but others will not be as reliable. "</p><p>After interacting with the Programmer's Assistant, many participants commented on how the experience was better than they anticipated, because it "seemed to be able to handle complex issues" (P10) and "was a great help" (P8). P20 felt it was "incredible!" P6 and P17, who were both initially skeptical, reported having a positive experience. For P6, "It absolutely exceeded all my expectations, in all aspects that I could have imagined and more!" P17 provided a more quantitative assessment: "Initial expectations: 3 Actual: 9.5." P38 was emphatic in their evaluation: "I was blown away how well it allowing me to structure how I want the code to look and work and just giving me the thing I asked for. "</p><p>Many participants described a sense of surprise in their experiences. P9 was surprised by how well it understood their requests:</p><p>" Participants also reported experiencing this variability in the quality of the assistant's responses. Some participants described how the assistant provided "detailed answers" (P17) and "high quality outputs" (P18) that were "surprisingly good" (P2). P6 felt it was "incredible to see the quality of the responses, " and P3 even explored the assistant's capabilities outside the scope of the challenges and found that it could handle those as well:</p><p>"It was surprising the quality of the code and the ability to answer all my questions correctly. Although I think the challenges may be biased towards what the Assistant is able to do, it was a great experience because I asked many other things and it was able to answer correctly. " (P3)</p><p>Of course, the Programmer's Assistant wasn't perfect, and some participants did run into issues. For P35, "The documentation generation did not perform very well. " P16 questioned the accuracy of the knowledge encoded in the model: "Does the model need to be updated? It said latest python version is 3.7 but google says it's 3.10. " In some instances, participants needed to ask their question multiple times to get a good response: "you need to ask many times if you want to get an answer and also a detailed explanation" (P3). P27 felt, "it was annoying when I asked it to try again and it would give me the same response. " P22 struggled because, "It didn't seem to handle multiple sentences well. "</p><p>P28 perhaps offered the most scathing criticism, that, "It makes mistakes often enough to be not very practical." However, despite the production of poorer-quality responses, other participants felt that the assistant was still helpful. P36 reported that, "Only minor tweaks were normally needed to correct any issues." Similarly, P38 described how the assistant wasn't able to completely solve their problem, but provided a useful start:</p><p>"There was only one hickup I noticed where when I asked it to memoize fibonacci it couldn't, but it dropped the building blocks on my lap for me to finish so that was fine, that was like minutes of effort on my part." (P38) 5.2.4 UI Design &amp; Affordances. Participants made many comments on our specific UI design and the affordances provided (or not provided) in our chat-augmented editor. Overall, the integration between the chat pane and the code editor was "very good" (P23), with a "nice interface between the code pane and the assistant pane" (P17) that "makes it really convenient" (P35).</p><p>Prior research by Brandt et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="11,183.20,350.81,14.72,7.94" target="#b14">[15]</ref> has shown how keeping developers focused in their IDE improves productivity, and our participants expressed similar sentiments. P40 remarked, "It allows me to stay in one browser window/tab!" and P12 hinted at how the interface might preserve their flow state by "prevent[ing] me from getting distracted when looking into an issue in another tab. " Some aspects of our user interface were confusing to participants, such as the mechanism for selecting code to be included in the conversational context. P7 remarked, "It's was a little confusing doing the selection part for it to tell me what a function does, but... it gave me code that was insanely easy to copy and paste." Other participants appreciated the code selection mechanism, such as P11: "I enjoyed the code selection feature, and found that very easy to use. "</p><p>In the event logs, we identified 20 instances in which a participant unintentionally included selected code in the conversation when it wasn't needed (Includes Extraneous Selection), 12 instances in which a code selection was omitted when it was needed to provide context for the question (Missing Selection), and 16 instances in which a participant copy/pasted code directly into the chat rather than selecting it in the editor (Pasted Code in Chat). Although these cases represent a small fraction of the 227 instances in which a code selection was required and included in the conversation (Includes Selection), their presence does indicate that more attention is needed to the interaction design of code selection.</p><p>Another issue regarded the awareness of the "try again" and "start over" features. The "try again" feature was only used by 14 participants, who used it a total of 63 times over the course of the study. Some participants used it specifically when they got an answer which they saw as clearly wrong, while others used it to get a variety of possible answers before proceeding. The "start over" feature was used even less, by 5 participants who used it a total of 6 times. Despite our effort to surface these conversational features in the UI via shortcut buttons, they may not have been sufficiently noticeable or salient: "The 'try again' button is not so reachable, often times I forgot it exists" (P23). By contrast, at least one participant was successful with these features:</p><p>"at some point it had issue with challenge 3 and I had to start over. Just asking 'try again' was not enough and I was getting always the same (wrong and not related) answer. starting again solved the issue!" (P20)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Utility of Conversational Assistance</head><p>Our next set of themes concerns the utility provided by conversational programming assistance. Participants felt the assistant was highly valuable and desired to use it in their own work. They felt it would be most helpful for smaller or narrowly-scoped tasks, but able to provide a wide variety of types of assistance. The fact that the interaction model was conversational and grounded in code were valuable aspects, as was the ability for the assistant to bolster users' learning about programming topics through that interaction. Participants did question whether they could trust and rely upon the assistant's responses, echoing a similar theme discussed in Weisz et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="11,371.04,308.22,17.39,7.94" target="#b102">[102]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.1">Value &amp; Appropriate</head><p>Tasks. Participants rated the value of the Programmer's Assistant highly (M (SD) = 8.6 (1.4) of 10). Many participants asked questions such as, "Can I have it in my editor please?" (P15), or made comments that, "I would enjoy using it in the future" (P36), "I would love to be able to... have access to it for my coding" (P37), and "I'd love to use this tool as part of my usual programming workflow if I could!" (P39). Some of the reasons why participants found it valuable are because it "help[s] me remember how to do things in certain languages that normally I would just Google" (P9) and "It helps me to avoid silly syntax errors and can when I cannot remember exact function/method names and required arguments" (P40). We did not observe any differences in value ratings based on participants' familiarity with or recency of using Python.</p><p>Participants described a wide variety of tasks for which they felt the assistant would be useful. These tasks included "ordinary" (P23), "simpler" (P2), and "small, repetitive" (P4) tasks such as "quick lookups" (P25) for "short chunks of code" (P11) or for "narrowed questions" (P26). Participants also felt the assistant was useful for "small containable novel algorithms" (P38) and "little coding problems" (P4).</p><p>Several kinds of task assistance were reported as being valuable, such as explaining code (P31), implementing business logic in a UI (P38), understanding what code does (P19, P37), and recalling language syntax, method names, and arguments (P12, P15, P20, P40, P42). P27 felt that the assistant was "More helpful when recognizing a specific well known algorithm but not things you make yourself. "</p><p>Participants also made recommendations for how to increase the value of the Programmer's Assistant. P38 suggested, "What would blow me away though is if it's able to help with what I do most often which is to integrate, refactor and iterate on an existing system. " P16, P26, and P38 all desired more information on the data sources used to produce the assistant's responses. P9 requested to "Have the Programmer's Assistant examine your code and make proactive suggestions for improving it in the chat." P36 requested the same, but cautioned that, "Care would need to be taken to avoid becoming an annoyance or disrupting the flow of a coding session. "</p><p>In the post-task survey, we probed participants on how certain changes to the Programmer's Assistant would either decrease, increase, or result in no change to its value. Over 75% of participants felt that the assistant would be more valuable if it operated in a proactive manner, either by making improvement suggestions in the chat or as comments directly in the code. Similarly, 78.6% of participants felt that having more buttons in the UI for common features such as explaining or documenting code would make the tool more valuable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.2">Conversational</head><p>Interactions Grounded in Code. One of the challenges in interpreting participants' comments about the utility of the Programmer's Assistant was in disentangling the extent to which value was derived from the quality of the underlying model versus the integration of conversation in a code context. Indeed, participants felt that the chat interaction was valuable: 69.0% of participants felt that eliminating the conversational interaction and making the assistant behave more like web search would decrease its value. Further, our analysis of the conversation transcripts revealed that 42% of the 910 task-oriented utterances from participants required historical conversational context (Chat Context Required) in order to be correctly interpreted. Thus, we observe that behaviorally, participants did rely on conversational context in their interactions.</p><p>In the post-task survey, 83% of participants rated the importance of the ability to ask follow-up questions as being "somewhat" or "a great deal. " Several participants specifically commented on the value of this conversational context. P39 remarked, "I absolutely loved how you can straight up ask follow-up questions to the Programmers' Assistant without having to reiterate the original topic/question. " P15 expressed a similar sentiment, saying, "I think the conversational context was someone helpful, just in communicating that it's a running conversation where my context is remembered. " P9 provided a similar analysis:</p><p>"This tool was so helpful at answering questions I had about the code in the context of the code I am working on... I was also impressed with how well it was able to remember the context of our conversation, especially when I asked vague follow-up questions. " (P9)</p><p>In addition, some participants identified how a conversational interaction grounded in code was useful, "because I think to 'understand' the dev context could be VERY important" (P31). In fact, 24.9% of task-oriented utterances included a relevant code selection (Includes Selection), showing that participants valued this ability.</p><p>Contrasting with these participants, P18 felt that interacting with the assistant conversationally was tedious, and they employed a more direct approach: "I really like the PA. But, I didn't converse with it like a chat bot. I often told it what to do ('Document this code.') as opposed to asking it what to do ('How do I document this code?'). Talking to it the way that was suggested in the tutorial seemed overly verbose/tedious. " (P18) Despite these individual differences in interaction preferences, P39 envisioned that both interaction styles could be supported in the tool:</p><p>"I think both options should exist: people should be able to input their queries like a search bar AND also give their question as if in conversation. " (P39) 5.3.3 Learning Effects. One specific benefit of the Programmer's Assistant identified by participants is its ability to help people improve their programming skills and reinforce knowledge gaps. For example, it can help users "remember how to do things in certain languages... such as, when I am using a language I haven't used in a while" (P9). The assistant can also serve as an memory aid, such as when "I use a lot of libraries that I don't always remember all of the functions" (P15). Similarly, P31 said, "No matter how good you're as a developer, you can't (humanly) remember all the API of hundreds of libs or new languages... I'd learn new dev lang and new lib/frameworks faster. "</p><p>P39 felt the assistant "is perfect for programmers of all levels, " and P1 felt it could help them rapidly improve their Python skills: "I have wanted to learn python... The main concern how much time spent learning is needed before I could actually get some value out of learning python. I have a feeling this would cut that time down from weeks to a day or so. " (P1) P39 also identified the fact that, because the interactions with the assistant are conversational, it forces people to learn how to communicate to others about their code: "The conversation aspect promotes proper communication, which would really stand to benefit budding programmers if they want to learn how to explain concepts more fluently in the future to their colleagues." (P39) Conversely, P36 suggested that over-reliance on programming assistance might have a detrimental effect to one's learning: "It's definitely a huge time saver, but over-reliance on it may cause new developers to skip learning the reference material themselves and discovering new things and sparking new ideas. " (P36) 5.3.4 Trust. Many participants raised questions about whether they could trust the responses provided by the Programmer's Assistant. P21 asked this question most directly: "will the code be correct, safe, efficient?" Other participants raised similar questions, such as, "I'm wondering how it validates it's answers, if it can be trusted to always give a working answer" (P10), and "Sometimes lack of source and context may raise doubts in the mind of the programmer" (P16).</p><p>These issues of trust were exacerbated by the fact that the Programmer's Assistant did not allow participants to actually run their code. Because of this limitation, participants had to rely on their own knowledge to judge the correctness of the assistant's responses. P19 asserted, "There is no way to evaluate if the Programmer's assistant is giving you the right advise or not other than your own knowledge, " and P9 concurred: "I had to trust that it was correct (and use my own prior knowledge). "</p><p>P18 described the potential consequences of allowing the assistant to write code for them:</p><p>"The only thing that made me nervous was that it could have introduced a bug that wasn't immediately apparent. And given I didn't write the code, I could have easily glossed over a mistake when reviewing it. Especially if it is also the one writing the test cases. " (P18)</p><p>Despite our efforts to make the Programmer's Assistant respond in non-authoritative ways, we did observe participants sometimes uncritically accept generated results that were clearly wrong or incomplete. Thus, we did find behavioral evidence for over-reliance.</p><p>Listing 2: Building trust through explanations and justifications One way to address trust issues is for the assistant to provide further explanations and justifications that can calibrate a user's confidence in the assistant's responses. Such explanations could be requested conversationally, though most participants did not attempt to do so. One participant (P9) did ask for such explanations, and we show a summary of their transcript in Listing 2. In this instance, P9 asked for a definition of a unit test (line 1), an explanation of the code being tested (line 25), and justifications of the quality of the unit test (lines 31&amp; 37). Thus, we observe that the assistant is capable of producing explanations and justifications when asked.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Patterns of Interaction and Mental Models</head><p>Participants interacted with the assistant in a variety of ways with two main patterns of usage standing out: (1) invoking the assistant to solve the entire programming challenge, and (2) breaking the challenge down into a set of smaller tasks and invoking the assistant's help for each. There were no clear differences in how participants with differing Python experience approached the tasks.</p><p>Participants' mental models of the assistant also varied. Although participants strongly saw the role of the assistant as being a tool, their behaviors revealed that in many cases, they actually treated it as a social agent. In addition, participants ascribed various mental capacities to the assistant, such as having the ability to understand, compute, and learn.</p><p>Participants felt the assistant changed the nature of their work process. For some participants, it enabled them to focus on the higher-level aspects of development because the assistant handled lower-level details or provided partial solutions for them to build upon. Many participants felt the assistant sped up their work and helped them remain focused on their tasks.</p><p>Finally, participants drew comparisons between the Programmer's Assistant with other forms of programming support such as Copilot and web search. They felt that the conversational style of interaction enabled them to discover new, emergent behaviors from the model that were unavailable from Copilot's focus on code autocompletion. They also felt that the examples provided by the assistant were more readily usable within their own code compared to browsing for answers within search results, speeding up the coding process. However, some participants advocated for a balanced approach to the design of programming assistance tools by incorporating multiple modes of interaction rather than fixating on a single one.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.1">Interaction</head><p>Styles and Assistant Role. We observed that participants interacted with the Programmer's Assistant in strikingly different ways. Some participants would present the entire challenge description to the assistant and then work with the results it produced. Other participants approached the programming challenges in a piecemeal fashion, breaking them apart into a set of smaller tasks, then invoking the assistant to aid with each one.</p><p>Experience with Python was not a determinant of how participants approached the programming challenges, but it did seem to impact how participants interacted with the assistant. Less experienced participants tended to ask the assistant basic questions such as, "What is a unit test" (P29, not familiar with Python) and "how do I document a function?" (P27, &lt; 1 year of experience). More experienced participants made detailed requests about specific Python libraries or algorithms, such as, "given a pandas dataframe with two columns 'Date' and 'Sales' please use matplotlib to draw me a scatterplot" (P38, 3+ years of experience) and "implement a rungekutta algorithm for solving an ODE with adaptive time steps" (P37, 3+ years of experience).</p><p>Another difference we observed in how people interacted with the assistant stemmed from their view on the role it played in their collaborative process. Some participants, such as P18, treated it more as a tool by issuing commands rather than asking questions. As quoted earlier, they said, "I didn't converse with it like a chat bot. " P5 described their interaction style similarly: "I found myself wanting to type search queries into Socrates, not treating it as a person but as a search tool. "</p><p>In anticipation that participants would have different orientations to the assistant and its role, we asked a question on the posttask survey about the different kinds of roles the assistant might take. These roles generally fell into one of two categories: a tool orientation (a tool, a reference guide, a content generator, a problem solver), and a social orientation (a collaborator, a colleague, a coach, an advisor, a reviewer). Participants rated the extent to which they viewed the Programmer's Assistant in each of these roles on a 4point scale of extent: Not at all (1), A little (2), Somewhat (3), or A great deal (4).  We show participants' ratings of the assistant's role in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="14,289.31,559.03,3.06,7.94" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. Despite the fact that their attitudes toward the assistant overwhelmingly reflected a tool orientation, their behaviors reveal that many participants actually treated the assistant as a social agent. P6 described how "I felt it like a partner," and P4 told the assistant, "I could not have solved [the challenge] without your help," to which the assistant responded, "I'm glad I could help. "</p><p>The literature on Computers as Social Agents (CASA) helps us interpret this result as it demonstrates how computers are often treated like people <ref type="bibr" coords="14,124.23,657.66,13.53,7.94" target="#b55">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,140.01,657.66,10.15,7.94" target="#b66">67]</ref>. LLM-based conversational agents can exacerbate this tendency; as they likely have been trained on examples of social interaction, they can also respond as social agents.</p><p>In the conversation logs, we identified participants who interacted with the assistant in a socially-oriented fashion (the social orientation codes in Table <ref type="table" coords="14,414.95,87.79,2.93,7.94" target="#tab_4">1</ref>). Twenty participants (47.6%) made at least one socially-oriented utterance. An extreme form of this interaction style can be seen in a snippet from P6's transcript (Listing 3).</p><p>The 20 participants with a behaviorally-demonstrated social orientation did not generally differ in their role ratings from other participants, except that they rated the assistant as more likely to be an advisor (Fisher's exact test, two-tailed 𝑝 = .02) or a reviewer (Fisher's exact test, two-tailed 𝑝 = .03). However, they did not differ in their overwhelmingly-strong ratings of the tool orientations. Thus, at least for some participants, there seems to be a dissonance in their view of the assistant's role orientation.</p><p>Listing 3: Excerpt from P6's interaction with the Programmer's Assistant, in which P6 offers their thanks and congratulations. Socrates : Goodbye .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.2">Mental</head><p>Capacities. Participants made a number of inferences about the Programmer's Assistant and its capacities for thought.</p><p>Many participants talked about how the assistant possessed a level of "understanding" (P6, P8, P11, P18, P32) of "the context" (P9, P21) as well as "major concepts" (P9) and "knowledge" (P33). P24 was amazed by the assistant's ability to "take a plain english request and interpret it properly." P7 ascribed intelligence to the assistant, saying, "It was a lot smarter and trained tha[n] I thought it was. " One participant assumed that the assistant "Keeps improving through (user) feedback" (P31). Another felt that the assistant was capable of computation: "It understands the problem... It can calculate the results of a function back" (P8).</p><p>However, not all participants were convinced of the assistant's ability to understand. P37 questioned the assistant's limitations: "I wonder how far beyond boilerplate it can go and if it works for truly original problems. "</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.3">Impact of Conversational</head><p>Assistance on Work Practices. Many participants discussed how the Programmer's Assistant shaped their work practices on the programming challenges. Overall, participants felt that the assistant "saves time" (P10), "helps me code faster" (P34), and would "speed up my productivity" (P19) because "I could focus on validating and improving the code it generated instead of having to write it all from scratch" (P18). P37 remarked that, "It opens a whole new door for fast develpment. " P4 discussed how the assistant "was helpful in staying focused on the code, " although for P14, "it took [me] time to get into tempo with the tool. "</p><p>P31 pointed out how the assistant would change the nature of their work: "My job could focus more on higher level aspects and therefore achieving better (quality) results, besides the time-to-value... Data science (and dev) becomes a more creative-higher level experience. " (P31) Other participants discussed a work process in which the assistant provided incomplete solutions -the "building blocks" (P38) or "initial draft of code" (P11) -upon which they could build. P5 aptly described this process: "It's nice to copy well formulated challenges in natural language and have the code generator take its best stab at it, then edit to our hearts content. " (P5)</p><p>Participants felt that human review of the assistant's responses was necessary because "The answers provided are generally not novel solutions, often look clunky and non-elegant. There may be some unnecessary code. Basically the code would need to be reviewed" (P16). P35 also pointed out how "The code generator was good but you still have to really check it. " P19 discussed how they would turn to the assistant as a first source for support, and only if it wasn't able to help would they then turn to other support tools:</p><p>"The way I will use it is, I will first us[e] the Programmer's assistant for most of my cases. Only in certain cases where Programmer's assistant cant answer things I will turn up to official documentation or stack overflow. "</p><p>However, latency was a factor for interactive use of the assistant and participants noticed when the assistant took a long time to respond. P19 remarked, "Sometimes it took lot of time, like more than 5 seconds. " P40 also felt "the response [was] a little slow sometimes... in chat mode I expect faster responses. " As discussed in Section 5.2.1, the assistant took an average of 6.7 seconds (SD = 3.1 seconds) to respond to a request, and participants did appreciate when the assistant produced rapid responses: "I loved how quick it was able to pull up answers to questions I had" (P38).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.4">Conversational Interaction vs. Other Interaction Models.</head><p>Although our study was not intended to make comparative evaluations with the Copilot tool, we nonetheless asked participants whether they were familiar with Copilot, and if so, to comment on how the two tools compared. We also asked a similar question to compare the assistant with another popular form of programming assistance, searching the web (via a search engine like Google, or a Q&amp;A site like Stack Overflow). In discussing the differences between these three tools, we note that the primary differentiator is their interaction model.</p><p>The interaction model for the Programmer's Assistant is clearly conversational: users ask questions in natural language and are provided with a response in natural language and/or code. The interaction model of Copilot is reminiscent of direct manipulation interfaces <ref type="bibr" coords="15,93.00,602.86,13.49,7.94" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, in which the user's actions in the user interface directly manipulate an object on the screen. Copilot automatically makes autocompletion suggestions as the user types. This autocompleted code is directly placed in the source editor; thus, the user's work is contained entirely within the scope of the object on which they are working (i.e. the source code), which is how direct manipulation interfaces operate. In web search, users enter a separate search context (e.g. a search engine accessed within a web browser), type in a natural language query, and then forage amongst search results to identify relevant items of interest <ref type="bibr" coords="15,266.71,701.49,13.40,7.94" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,282.03,701.49,10.05,7.94" target="#b61">62]</ref>.</p><p>When a desirable item is found, users must translate it into their code environment (e.g. via copy/paste) and possibly edit it to fit their existing code.</p><p>We also note that the Programmer's Assistant and Copilot both utilize the same underlying AI model, Codex <ref type="bibr" coords="15,489.06,131.63,13.49,7.94" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, which means that the only difference between these tools is the user experience. The extent to which Codex was trained on data from programmingrelated Q&amp;A web sites is less clear, but for the purposes of our analysis, we focus our discussion solely on the differences in their interaction models <ref type="foot" coords="15,386.32,184.27,6.76,6.44" target="#foot_15">16</ref> .</p><p>Participants reported various benefits and drawbacks of a conversational interaction over a direct manipulation interaction. Foremost, conversation "felt very natural" (P21) and "feels much more natural using Natural Language with the AI" (P39). In addition, P39 felt that "the use cases of Programmers' Assistant seem more openended. " Many participants were surprised at the variety of tasks the assistant was capable of performing, from writing unit tests (P19, P36, P37) and documentation (P12, P19, P36, P37) to explaining what code did (P31, P38) and even answering general-knowledge questions (P31). Again, we note that the Programmer's Assistant utilizes the same underlying model as Copilot, yet the conversational interface was able to expose a wider variety of emergent behaviors from the model. Multiple participants explored the limits of the assistant's knowledge and abilities beyond our programming challenges. For example, P37 asked it questions about physics and ordinary differential equations ("ODe" as written by P37), and was surprised by the "versatility of what it could answer. " "I asked it some physics and ODe question and the answers, though not complete, included the key parts needed to write that code. " (P37) P31 probed the assistant on its knowledge of geography and was surprised when the assistant produced a correct answer.</p><p>"I asked something out of SW engineering domain (geography) and it replied correctly, also by correctly answering on my nationality. " (P31) For some participants, the ability to assess the assistant's response before committing to it (i.e. by inserting assistant-generated code into their editor) was a boon. P15 described how the copy/paste boundary provided them with "a bit more control to ask specific questions about what I wanted and to assess before putting it in my code." Other participants felt that the copy/paste boundary was more inefficient: "I think the main difference is the ability of Copilot to suggest code while you type, what make it faster and easier to use. While using the Programmer's Assistant, you need to go to the chat, ask the question, copy the code (or rephrase the question if it was not understood by the agent), and edit it to match your code. " (P3) A large number of participants felt that the conversational interaction was faster than web search (P1, P6, P7, P10, P11, P12, P16, P17, P18, P20, P24, P29, P30, P33, P36, P37, P42) because of its ability to provide "real-time responses" (P32) that can be "applied exactly to your code" (P33) without having to "parse through lots of text... to get what you need" (P15). In addition, the assistant provided "MUCH faster, better responses" (P17) that were "much more relevant to the problems" (P34) and "simple <ref type="bibr" coords="16,155.72,188.97,18.91,8.97">[and]</ref> succinct" (P9), without having to "sort through answers on your own or read documentation" (P9) or "look at many posts before finding the relevant one" (P18).</p><p>Despite these benefits, some participants felt that the assistant might not work well for "more specific and difficult problems on a bigger scale" as compared to web search. P9 felt that "the data [of the Programmer's Assistant] wasn't as rich" as the web. Other participants felt that the assistant lacked the "multiple answers" (P9) and "rich social commentary" (P19) that accompanies answers on Q&amp;A sites: "I like to see the different versions proposed on stack overflow and the commentary of what makes one solution better than another in a given situation. " (P27) Some participants promoted a more balanced view that there isn't a single mode of interaction superior to all others. P19 felt that web search would be a fallback when the assistant failed to answer a question. P39 described how search could be integrated with the conversational interaction:</p><p>"I think both options should exist: people should be able to input their queries like a search bar AND also give their question as if in conversation. " (P39)</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Value of Conversational Interaction</head><p>We began our research by asking the question of whether contemporary developments in code-fluent LLMs could sufficiently support a conversational programming assistant. We believe that our work has demonstrated that they can. Clearly, the Programmer's Assistant was viewed by our participants as a useful tool that provided real value -so much so that many participants explicitly requested or expressed the desire to use it in their own work. However, how much of this value was derived from the model itself and its ability to produce high-quality responses to programming questions, versus from participants' ability to conduct extended conversational interactions grounded in their actual source code?</p><p>We believe that both of these constituent aspects were valuable. Indeed, many participants commented on their surprise and satisfaction with the quality of the assistant's responses (Section 5.2.3). However, participants also valued the conversational interactions that they had with the assistant. In the event logs, we saw evidence that participants were leveraging conversational context to ask follow-up questions as well as leveraging code context by asking about their code selections (Section 5.3.2). Many participants reported that they would find the tool less valuable if the conversational interaction were removed (Section 5.3.2). Further, conversation seemed to provide unique value beyond other interaction models (direct manipulation and search) because of its embeddedness in the UI and its ability to surface emergent behaviors of the model (Section 5.4.4).</p><p>We do not believe that these different interaction models are in competition and we agree with P39's assessment that assistive tools can be built using a plethora of different interaction models. For use cases in which a model is known to produce high-quality results (e.g. code autocompletion for Codex), a direct manipulation interface seems wholly appropriate as it would provide a discoverable and predictable way of invoking the model to produce a known type of result. However, direct manipulation interfaces may be less ideal for surfacing the emergent behaviors of a foundation model <ref type="bibr" coords="16,341.90,219.30,13.22,7.94" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, and thus natural language interaction may be more suitable. Many popular text-to-image models, such as DALL-E 2 <ref type="bibr" coords="16,543.39,230.26,14.81,7.94" target="#b65">[66]</ref> and Stable Diffusion <ref type="bibr" coords="16,394.82,241.22,13.41,7.94" target="#b71">[72]</ref>, operate in a one-shot fashion, in which the user specifies a prompt, clicks a button, and gets results. Our study demonstrates how the additional contextual layers of conversational history and the artifact-under-development provide additional value to the co-creative process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Toward Human-AI Synergy</head><p>The aim of human-centered AI is to "enable[] people to see, think, create, and act in extraordinary ways, by combining potent user experiences with embedded AI methods to support services that users want" <ref type="bibr" coords="16,361.64,361.98,13.22,7.94" target="#b81">[82]</ref>. Building upon this definition, Rezwana and Maher <ref type="bibr" coords="16,317.96,372.93,14.72,7.94" target="#b68">[69]</ref> posit that, "In a creative collaboration, interaction dynamics, such as turn-taking, contribution type, and communication, are the driving forces of the co-creative process. Therefore the interaction model is a critical and essential component for effective co-creative systems." <ref type="bibr" coords="16,354.37,416.77,13.49,7.94" target="#b68">[69]</ref>. They go on to note that, "There is relatively little research about interaction design in the co-creativity field, which is reflected in a lack of focus on interaction design in many existing co-creative systems. "</p><p>Our study begins to address this gap. While many co-creative systems examine casual tasks or experimental activities (e.g., Spoto and Oleynik <ref type="bibr" coords="16,367.50,482.52,12.97,7.94" target="#b86">[87]</ref>), our focus was on the co-creative practice of programming. Our goal was to understand peoples' attitudes toward a conversational programming assistant, akin to Wang et al.'s examination of data scientists' attitudes toward automated data science technologies <ref type="bibr" coords="16,394.43,526.36,13.29,7.94" target="#b99">[99]</ref>. We found that, despite an initial level of skepticism, participants felt that a conversational assistant would provide value by improving their productivity (Section 5.4.3). However, further work is needed to assess the extent to which this type of assistance provides measurable productivity increases.</p><p>Campero et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="16,384.24,581.15,14.72,7.94" target="#b18">[19]</ref> conducted a survey of papers published in 2021 that examined human-AI synergy, the notion that a human-AI team can accomplish more by working together than either party could accomplish working alone. They found mixed results, with no clear consensus emerging on how to design human-centered AI systems that can guarantee positive synergy. Summarizing from their discussion, "Perhaps achieving substantial synergies among people and computers is harder than many people think. Perhaps it requires... new ways of configuring groups that include people and computers. And perhaps it needs more systematic, focused attention from researchers than it has, so far, received. " <ref type="bibr" coords="17,180.08,98.75,29.64,7.94">[19, p.9]</ref> We believe such evaluations of human-AI synergy should go beyond one-shot performance measures. As implied by many of the uses cases listed by Seeber et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="17,172.55,137.00,13.36,7.94" target="#b79">[80]</ref>, human-centered AI systems are often deployed in socio-organizational contexts that require longitudinal use <ref type="bibr" coords="17,114.54,158.92,13.45,7.94" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="17,130.24,158.92,10.29,7.94" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="17,142.78,158.92,10.09,7.94" target="#b42">43]</ref>, such as product design <ref type="bibr" coords="17,243.51,158.92,13.29,7.94" target="#b92">[93]</ref>, game design <ref type="bibr" coords="17,70.73,169.88,9.27,7.94" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and engineering <ref type="bibr" coords="17,145.18,169.88,13.40,7.94" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="17,160.55,169.88,46.50,7.94">Section 3.2.2]</ref>. Thus, we would expect that over time and through interaction with each other, human-AI teams would improve their performance through a mutual learning process.</p><p>Evidence for this process surfaced in our study when participants described how they could improve their programming skills by interacting with the assistant (Section 5.3.3). We assert that the learning should operate in both directions: not only should people improve their programming skills, but the model itself can also improve based on peoples' interactions with it. For example, when the assistant provides a code example to the user, and the user takes that example and edits it, those edits constitute feedback that can be used to further fine-tune the model. In addition, through longitudinal use, we believe that human and AI partners can create reciprocal representations of one another -i.e., the human is likely to create a mental model of the AI, and the AI may be engineered to develop a user model for each of its human users <ref type="bibr" coords="17,227.62,345.22,13.40,7.94" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="17,243.01,345.22,10.27,7.94" target="#b47">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="17,255.26,345.22,10.05,7.94" target="#b78">79]</ref>. Such a pair of models is often described as Mutual Theory of Mind <ref type="bibr" coords="17,262.82,356.18,13.40,7.94" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="17,277.86,356.18,14.06,7.94" target="#b100">100]</ref>. This type of capability raises the possibility of personalizing and adapting an assistant to the strengths and needs of individual users.</p><p>With such models, an assistant that knows a user is learning a programming language could provide natural language explanations alongside code outputs, whereas an assistant that knows a user is strongly skilled in a programming language might shorten or omit those explanations. Similarly, users are likely to update their mental models of the AI with more experience. We believe the space for exploring how these reciprocal models impact human-AI synergy is rich, and we encourage additional work in this area.</p><p>Human-centered AI systems that are designed to combine and synergize the distinct skills of humans and AI models cannot succeed if they diminish the human skills upon which they depend. Well-designed human-centered AI systems develop new and complementary skills for both the human and AI constituents <ref type="bibr" coords="17,265.83,520.57,13.49,7.94" target="#b81">[82,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="17,281.54,520.57,10.12,7.94" target="#b82">83]</ref>, and we believe that mutual learning may address concerns that the wide deployment and use of AI systems will result in a de-skilling of the workforce <ref type="bibr" coords="17,116.97,553.44,13.50,7.94" target="#b76">[77,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="17,132.71,553.44,14.14,7.94" target="#b108">108]</ref>.</p><p>Ultimately, the design decisions that go into an interactive AI system have ethical implications. Our design attempts to augment the user's knowledge and skills by presenting help on demand, couched in non-authoritative suggestions, which leaves the user firmly in control and ultimately responsible for the work product.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Opportunities for Future Research</head><p>Our work highlights many interesting avenues for future enhancements that could be made to LLM-based conversational assistants such as our Programmer's Assistant, as well as future humancentered research on LLM-based conversational assistance.</p><p>Our work employed a code-fluent model that was not specifically designed to handle conversational interaction. Fine-tuning the underlying LLM for conversational interaction, such as what has been done with Lamda <ref type="bibr" coords="17,417.05,98.75,13.26,7.94" target="#b90">[91]</ref>, is one opportunity to improve the assistant's performance. Another opportunity is to align the language model to follow the desiderata proposed by Askell et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="17,543.48,120.67,14.72,7.94" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and described by Ouyang et al. as, "helpful (they should help the user solve their task), honest (they shouldn't fabricate information or mislead the user), and harmless (they should not cause physical, psychological, or social harm to people or the environment)" [61, p.2]. Glaese et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="17,386.27,175.46,14.72,7.94" target="#b32">[33]</ref> propose a slightly different desiderata of "correct" instead of "honest, " which may be more applicable to the software engineering domain, as the ability to produce correct code and correct answers about code are both important properties of a conversational programming assistant.</p><p>Combining LLMs with search-based approaches to establish additional context for the model, such as AlphaCode <ref type="bibr" coords="17,506.99,241.22,14.85,7.94" target="#b43">[44]</ref> has done, may also result in more capable systems. These "searches" need not be limited to textual sources, but could be conducted over appropriate semantic stores (e.g. a knowledge graph) and take advantage of explicit semantic reasoning services, resulting in an integration of symbolic and neural approaches. Further, allowing for "internal deliberation" of the type shown in Nye et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="17,487.09,306.97,14.72,7.94" target="#b58">[59]</ref> could result in better-reasoned results, as well as better explanations and justifications.</p><p>Another avenue for improvement involves the prompt used to configure the assistant (Appendix D). Just as the prompt for each successive interaction is modified by the growth of the conversational transcript, there is no requirement that the initial prompt be static. It too can be specialized to incorporate aspects of a user model, enabling the realization of a Mutual Theory of Mind <ref type="bibr" coords="17,508.78,394.64,13.43,7.94" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="17,524.44,394.64,14.08,7.94" target="#b100">100]</ref>. Providing better UX affordances for visualizing and manipulating the active contexts -code and conversation -could provide users with more control over which information contributes to the generation of the assistant's response.</p><p>Our participants clearly indicated that they were interested in having an assistant that behaved more proactively, in contrast to our deliberate design of an assistant that never takes conversational initiative. A more proactive assistant would be able to interrupt or remind a user when necessary <ref type="bibr" coords="17,434.53,493.27,13.49,7.94" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, yet this characteristic raises many challenging issues. How can we calibrate the threshold for such interruptions? How can users tune the assistant to deliver only those interruptions that the they would find useful (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="17,524.75,526.15,13.50,7.94" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="17,540.49,526.15,10.86,7.94" target="#b80">81]</ref>)? How can we help users to regain their prior context after dealing with an interruption (e.g. <ref type="bibr" coords="17,417.27,548.07,14.37,7.94" target="#b88">[89]</ref>)? Should an assistant be used to persuade or nudge the user (e.g. <ref type="bibr" coords="17,445.61,559.03,14.37,7.94" target="#b34">[35]</ref>)? Who should determine the topic, frequency, and insistence of such persuasion attempts (e.g. <ref type="bibr" coords="17,334.85,580.94,13.53,7.94" target="#b51">[52,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="17,350.62,580.94,10.89,7.94" target="#b84">85]</ref>)? Should users have the ability to moderate or defeat attempted persuasions, or should those decisions be left to the organization?</p><p>Finally, we explored the different kinds of role orientations our participants had toward the assistant and found that participants varied in their views of it as a tool versus a social agent (e.g. collaborator or colleague). We posit that peoples' effectiveness in working with an AI system may be influenced by their role orientation, and we encourage future research in this area.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSION</head><p>We developed a prototype system, the Programmer's Assistant, in order to assess the utility of a conversational assistant in a software engineering context. The assistant was implemented using a stateof-the-art code-fluent large language model, Codex <ref type="bibr" coords="18,244.74,134.37,13.41,7.94" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, and was capable of generating both code and natural language responses to user inquiries. We further used the prompting mechanism of the model to set up a conversational interaction in which the model uses the conversational history, plus the user's current utterance, in order to generate a response. In this way, users are able to ask follow-up questions in the chat that reference prior utterances and responses. We incorporated the conversational assistant into a code editing environment, enabling the conversation to be grounded in the context of the user's source code.</p><p>We evaluated this system with 42 participants with varied levels of programming skill, and their quantitative and qualitative feedback, coupled with their usage of the system, demonstrated the varied, and sometimes emergent, types of assistance it was able to provide. Many participants noted the high quality of the conversational responses, including the assistant's ability to produce code, explain code, answer general programming questions, and even answer general knowledge questions. Participants felt this type of assistance would aid their productivity, and they drew meaningful contrasts between the conversational style of interaction with other tools that employ a direct manipulation or search-based interaction model.</p><p>Our study motivates the use of conversational styles of interaction with large language models by showing how they enable emergent behaviors in a co-creative context. The Programmer's Assistant did not always generate perfect code or correct answers; nonetheless, participants in our study had an overall positive experience working with it on a variety of programming challenges. We believe that our work takes us one step closer to realizing the vision of human-centered AI: learning how to design systems that maximize the synergy in human-AI collaborations. • Add buttons in the chat UI for common queries, such as "what does this code do?" or "document this code.

This survey took approximately 5 minutes to complete and began with the instructions below: Hello! We are a team of researchers looking for feedback on a prototype system we call the Programmer's Assistant.</p><p>The Programmer's Assistant is an experiment in conversational coding: it consists of a code editor integrated with a chatbot that is able to converse in natural language to answer questions, generate code, and consult on existing code.</p><p>In this study, you will be asked to complete several programming tasks. We are not evaluating your programming skills on these tasks. Rather, we are interested in understanding how the Programmer's Assistant is able to help you accomplish those tasks. Your code and interactions with the assistant will be processed by a 3rd party AI model, so please do not include proprietary code or discuss companyconfidential information. All data we collect in this study will be anonymized before it is published.</p><p>Before trying out the Programmer's Assistant, we would like to assess some of your expectations. We estimate that this survey will take 5 minutes. Open-ended response</p></div>
