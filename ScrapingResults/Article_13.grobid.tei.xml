<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The Surrogate Modeling Toolbox (SMT) is an open-source Python package that offers a collection of surrogate modeling methods, sampling techniques, and a set of sample problems. This paper presents SMT 2.0, a major new release of SMT that introduces significant upgrades and new features to the toolbox. This release adds the capability to handle mixed-variable surrogate models and hierarchical variables. These types of variables are becoming increasingly important in several surrogate modeling applications. SMT 2.0 also improves SMT by extending sampling methods, adding new surrogate models, and computing variance and kernel derivatives for Kriging. This release also includes new functions to handle noisy and use multi-fidelity data. To the best of our knowledge, SMT 2.0 is the first open-source surrogate library to propose surrogate models for hierarchical and mixed inputs.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Motivation and significance</head><p>With the increasing complexity and accuracy of numerical models, it has become more challenging to run complex simulations and computer codes <ref type="bibr" coords="1,59.64,487.38,10.09,7.43" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,69.73,487.38,6.73,7.43" target="#b1">2]</ref>. As a consequence, surrogate models have been recognized as a key tool for engineering tasks such as design space exploration, uncertainty quantification, and optimization <ref type="bibr" coords="1,197.28,508.46,10.09,7.43" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. In practice, surrogate models are used to reduce the computational effort of these tasks by replacing expensive numerical simulations with closed-form approximations <ref type="bibr" coords="1,69.20,540.08,10.09,7.43" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,82.92,540.08,26.37,7.43">Ch. 10]</ref>. To build such a model, we start by evaluating the original expensive simulation at a set of points through a Design of Experiments (DoE). Then, the corresponding evaluations are used to build the surrogate model according to the chosen approximation, such as Kriging, quadratic interpolation, or least squares regression.</p><p>The Surrogate Modeling Toolbox (SMT) is an open-source framework that provides functions to efficiently build surrogate models <ref type="bibr" coords="1,275.21,603.32,10.09,7.43" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. and number of instantiated elements. When design problems include both discrete variables and continuous variables, they are said to have mixed variables.</p><p>When architectural choices lead to different sets of design variables, we have hierarchical variables <ref type="bibr" coords="2,150.11,222.88,14.57,7.43" target="#b21">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,164.68,222.88,10.93,7.43" target="#b22">22]</ref>. For example, consider different aircraft propulsion architectures <ref type="bibr" coords="2,170.28,233.52,14.36,7.43" target="#b23">[23]</ref>. A conventional gas turbine would not require a variable to represent a choice in the electrical power source, while hybrid or pure electric propulsion would require such a variable. The relationship between the choices and the sets of variables can be represented by a hierarchy.</p><p>Handling hierarchical and mixed variables requires specialized surrogate modeling techniques <ref type="bibr" coords="2,141.92,297.71,14.36,7.43" target="#b24">[24]</ref>. To address these needs, SMT 2.0 is offering researchers and practitioners a collection of cutting-edge tools to build surrogate models with continuous, mixed and hierarchical variables. The main objective of this paper is to detail the new enhancements that have been added in this release compared to the original SMT 0.2 release <ref type="bibr" coords="2,100.36,350.90,10.09,7.43" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. There are two new major capabilities in SMT 2.0: the ability to build surrogate models involving mixed variables and the support for hierarchical variables within Kriging models. To handle mixed variables in Kriging models, existing libraries such as BoTorch <ref type="bibr" coords="2,270.73,393.81,14.36,7.43" target="#b25">[25]</ref>, Dakota <ref type="bibr" coords="2,64.40,404.45,14.36,7.43" target="#b26">[26]</ref>, DiceKriging <ref type="bibr" coords="2,127.57,404.45,14.36,7.43" target="#b27">[27]</ref>, LVGP <ref type="bibr" coords="2,168.93,404.45,14.36,7.43" target="#b28">[28]</ref>, Parmoo <ref type="bibr" coords="2,217.83,404.45,14.36,7.43" target="#b29">[29]</ref>, and Spearmint <ref type="bibr" coords="2,37.59,415.08,15.72,7.43" target="#b30">[30]</ref> implement simple mixed models by using either continuous relaxation (CR), also known as one-hot encoding <ref type="bibr" coords="2,195.05,425.72,14.36,7.43" target="#b30">[30]</ref>, or a Gower distance (GD) based correlation kernel <ref type="bibr" coords="2,143.67,436.36,14.36,7.43" target="#b31">[31]</ref>. KerGP <ref type="bibr" coords="2,188.02,436.36,15.72,7.43" target="#b32">[32]</ref> (developed in R) implements more general kernels but there is no Python open-source toolbox that implements more general kernels to deal with mixed variables, such as the homoscedastic hypersphere (HH) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,210.14,468.28,15.72,7.43" target="#b33">[33]</ref> and exponential homoscedastic hypersphere (EHH) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,164.73,478.91,15.72,7.43" target="#b34">[34]</ref> kernels. Such kernels require the tuning of a large number of hyperparameters but lead to more accurate Kriging surrogates than simpler mixed kernels <ref type="bibr" coords="2,241.11,500.19,14.57,7.43" target="#b34">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,255.68,500.19,10.93,7.43" target="#b35">35]</ref>. SMT 2.0 implements all these kernels (CR, GD, HH, and EHH) through a unified framework and implementation. To handle hierarchical variables, no library in the literature can build peculiar surrogate models except SMT 2.0, which implements two Kriging methods for these variables. Notwithstanding, most softwares are compatible with a naïve strategy called the imputation method <ref type="bibr" coords="2,173.69,564.02,15.72,7.43" target="#b24">[24]</ref> but this method lacks depth and depends on arbitrary choices. This is why Hutter and Osborne <ref type="bibr" coords="2,37.59,585.30,15.72,7.43" target="#b21">[21]</ref> proposed a first kernel, called Arc-Kernel which in turn was generalized by Horn et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,134.03,595.94,15.72,7.43" target="#b36">[36]</ref> with a new kernel called the Wedge-Kernel <ref type="bibr" coords="2,70.82,606.58,14.36,7.43" target="#b37">[37]</ref>. None of these kernels are available in any open-source modeling software. Furthermore, thanks to the framework introduced in Audet et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,94.11,627.85,14.36,7.43" target="#b38">[38]</ref>, our proposed kernels are sufficiently general so that all existing hierarchical kernels are included within it. Section 4 describes the two kernels implemented in SMT 2.0 that are referred as SMT Arc-Kernel and SMT Alg-Kernel. In particular, Alg-Kernel is a novel hierarchical kernel introduced in this paper. Table <ref type="table" coords="2,284.18,670.41,4.49,7.43" target="#tab_0">1</ref> outlines the main features of the state-of-the-art modeling software that can handle hierarchical and mixed variables.</p><p>SMT 2.0 introduces other enhancements, such as additional sampling procedures, new surrogate models, new Kriging kernels (and their derivatives), Kriging variance derivatives, and an adaptive criterion for high-dimensional problems. SMT 2.0 adds applications of Bayesian optimization (BO) with hierarchical and mixed variables or noisy co-Kriging that have been successfully applied to aircraft design <ref type="bibr" coords="2,522.31,191.04,14.36,7.43" target="#b39">[39]</ref>, data fusion <ref type="bibr" coords="2,330.50,202.11,14.36,7.43" target="#b40">[40]</ref>, and structural design <ref type="bibr" coords="2,427.51,202.11,14.36,7.43" target="#b41">[41]</ref>. The SMT 2.0 interface is more user-friendly and offers an improved and more detailed documentation for users and developers. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. First, we introduce the organization and the main implemented features of the release in Section 2. Then, we describe the mixed-variable Kriging model with an example in Section 3. Similarly, we describe and provide an example for a hierarchical-variable Kriging model in Section 4. The Bayesian optimization models and applications are described in Section 5. Finally, we describe the other relevant contributions in Section 6 and conclude in Section 7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">SMT 2.0 : an improved surrogate modeling toolbox</head><p>From a software point of view, SMT 2.0 maintains and improves the modularity and generality of the original SMT version <ref type="bibr" coords="2,518.43,502.76,10.09,7.43" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. In this section, we describe the software as follows. Section 2.1 describes the legacy of SMT 0.2. Then, Section 2.2 describes the organization of the repository. Finally, Section 2.3 shows the new capabilities implemented in the SMT 2.0 update.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Background on SMT former version: SMT 0.2</head><p>SMT <ref type="bibr" coords="2,337.12,602.92,11.23,7.43" target="#b4">[5]</ref> is an open-source collaborative work originally developed by ONERA, NASA Glenn, ISAE-SUPAERO/ICA and the University of Michigan. Now, both Polytechnique Montréal and the University of California San Diego are also contributors. SMT 2.0 updates and extends the original SMT repository capabilities among which the original publication <ref type="bibr" coords="2,349.68,658.27,11.23,7.43" target="#b4">[5]</ref> focuses on different types of derivatives for surrogate models detailed hereafter. A Python surrogate modeling framework with derivatives. One of the original main motivations for SMT was derivative support. In fact, none of the existing packages for surrogate modeling such as Scikit-learn in Python <ref type="bibr" coords="3,65.00,180.30,10.09,7.43" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, SUMO in Matlab <ref type="bibr" coords="3,142.36,180.30,15.72,7.43" target="#b42">[42]</ref> or GPML in Matlab and Octave <ref type="bibr" coords="3,272.96,180.30,15.72,7.43" target="#b43">[43]</ref> focuses on derivatives. Three types of derivatives are distinguished: prediction derivatives, training derivatives, and output derivatives. SMT also includes new models with derivatives such as Kriging with Partial Least Squares (KPLS) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,148.51,221.99,15.72,7.43" target="#b44">[44]</ref> and Regularized Minimal-energy Tensor-product Spline (RMTS) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,149.97,232.42,10.09,7.43" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. These developed derivatives were even used in a novel algorithm called Gradient-Enhanced Kriging with Partial Least Squares (GEKPLS) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,154.63,253.27,11.23,7.43" target="#b5">[6]</ref> to use with adjoint methods, for example <ref type="bibr" coords="3,69.77,263.69,14.36,7.43" target="#b45">[45]</ref>.</p><p>Software architecture, documentation, and automatic testing. SMT is organized along three main sub-modules that implement a set of sampling techniques (sampling_methods), benchmarking functions (problems), and surrogate modeling techniques (surrogate_models). The toolbox documentation <ref type="foot" coords="3,90.61,321.11,2.80,4.64" target="#foot_3">6</ref> is created using reStructuredText and Sphinx, a documentation generation package for Python, with custom extensions. Code snippets in the documentation pages are taken directly from actual tests in the source code and are automatically updated. The output from these code snippets and tables of options are generated dynamically by custom Sphinx extensions. This leads to high-quality documentation with minimal effort. Along with user documentation, developer documentation is also provided to explain how to contribute to SMT. This includes a list of API methods for the SurrogateModel, SamplingMethod, and Problem classes, that must be implemented to create a new surrogate modeling method, sampling technique, or benchmarking problem. When a developer submits a pull request, it is merged only after passing the automated tests and receiving approval from at least one reviewer. The repository on GitHub<ref type="foot" coords="3,238.74,456.62,2.80,4.64" target="#foot_4">7</ref> is linked to continuous integration tests (GitHub Actions) for Windows, Linux and MacOS, to a coverage test on coveralls.io and to a dependency version check for Python with DependaBot. Various parts of the source code have been accelerated using Numba <ref type="bibr" coords="3,169.66,499.00,14.36,7.43" target="#b46">[46]</ref>, an LLVM-based just-in-time (JIT) compiler for numpy-heavy Python code. Numba is applied to conventional Python code using function decorators, thereby minimizing its impact on the development process and not requiring an additional build step. For a mixed Kriging surrogate with 150 training points, a speedup of up to 80% is observed, see Table <ref type="table" coords="3,205.30,551.12,3.36,7.43" target="#tab_2">2</ref>. The JIT compilation step only needs to be done once when installing or upgrading SMT and adds an overhead of approximately 24 s on a typical workstation In this paper, all results are obtained using an Intel ® Xeon ® CPU E5-2650 v4 @ 2.20 GHz core and 128 GB of memory with a Broadwellgeneration processor front-end and a compute node of a peak power of 844 GFlops.</p></div>

The new major features implemented in SMT 2.0 are highlighted in lavender whereas the legacy features that were already in present in the original publication for SMT 0.2 <ref type="bibr" coords="3,355.00,88.88,11.23,7.43" target="#b4">[5]</ref> are in black.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">New features within SMT 2.0</head><p>The main objective of this new release is to enable Kriging surrogate models for use with both hierarchical and mixed variables. Moreover, for each of these five sub-modules described in Section 2.2, several improvements have been made between the original version and the SMT 2.0 release.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hierarchical and mixed design space.</head><p>A new design space definition class DesignSpace has been added that implements hierarchical and mixed functionalities. Design variables can either be continuous (FloatVariable), ordered (OrdinalVariable) or categorical (CategoricalVariable). The integer type (IntegerVariable) represents a special case of the ordered variable, specified by bounds (inclusive) rather than a list of possible values. The hierarchical structure of the design space can be defined using declare_decreed_var:</p><p>this function declares that a variable is a decreed variable that is activated when the associated meta variable takes one of a set of specified values, see Section 4 for background. The DesignSpace class also implements mechanisms for sampling valid design vectors (i.e. design vectors that adhere to the hierarchical structure of the design space) using any of the below-mentioned samplers, for correcting and imputing design vectors, and for requesting which design variables are acting in a given design vector. Correction ensures that variables have valid values (e.g. integers for discrete variables) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,539.75,378.54,14.35,7.43" target="#b24">[24]</ref>, and imputation replaces non-acting variables by some default value (0 for discrete variables, mid-way between the bounds for continuous variables in SMT 2.0) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,389.27,411.37,14.36,7.43" target="#b47">[47]</ref>.</p><p>Sampling. SMT implements three methods for sampling. The first one is a naïve approach, called Random that draws uniformly points along every dimension. The second sampling method is called Full Factorial and draws a point for every cross combination of variables, to have an ''exhaustive'' design of experiments. The last one is the Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,455.68,483.97,15.72,7.43" target="#b48">[48]</ref> that draws a point in every Latin square parameterized by a certain criterion. For LHS, a new criterion to manage the randomness has been implemented and the sampling method was adapted for multi-fidelity and mixed or hierarchical variables. More details about the new sampling techniques are given in Section 6.1.</p><p>Problems. SMT implements two new engineering problems: a mixed variant of a cantilever beam described in Section 3 and a hierarchical neural network described in Section 4.</p><p>Surrogate models. In order to keep up with state-of-art, several releases done from the original version developed new options for the already existing surrogates. In particular, compared to the original publication <ref type="bibr" coords="3,348.42,629.17,10.09,7.43" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, SMT 2.0 adds gradient-enhanced neural networks <ref type="bibr" coords="3,541.97,629.17,15.72,7.43" target="#b45">[45]</ref> and marginal Gaussian process <ref type="bibr" coords="3,424.79,640.11,15.72,7.43" target="#b49">[49]</ref> models to the list of available surrogates. More details about the new models are given in Section 6.2.</p><p>Applications. Several applications have been added to the toolbox to demonstrate the surrogate models capabilities. The most relevant application is efficient global optimization (EGO), a Bayesian optimization algorithm <ref type="bibr" coords="3,359.42,701.76,14.57,7.43" target="#b50">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,373.99,701.76,10.93,7.43" target="#b51">51]</ref>. EGO optimizes expensive-to-evaluate black-box problems with a chosen surrogate model and a chosen optimization criterion <ref type="bibr" coords="3,339.09,723.65,14.36,7.43" target="#b52">[52]</ref>. The usage of EGO with hierarchical and mixed variables is described in Section 5.  Interactive notebooks. These tutorials introduce and explain how to use the toolbox for different surrogate models and applications. 8 Every tutorial is available both as a .ipynb file and directly on Google colab. 9 In particular, a hierarchical and mixed variables dedicated notebook is available to reproduce the results presented on this paper. 10  In the following, Section 3 details the Kriging based surrogate models for mixed variables, and Section 4 presents our new Kriging surrogate for hierarchical variables. Section 5 details the EGO application and the other new relevant features aforementioned are described succinctly in Section 6. 8 https://github.com/SMTorg/smt/tree/master/tutorial 9 https://colab.research.google.com/github/SMTorg/smt/ 10 https://github.com/SMTorg/smt/tree/master/tutorial/ NotebookRunTestCases_Paper_SMT_v2.ipynb</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Surrogate models with mixed variables in SMT 2.0</head><p>As mentioned in Section 1, design variables can be either of continuous or discrete type, and a problem with both types is a mixed-variable problem. Discrete variables can be ordinal or categorical. A discrete variable is ordinal if there is an order relation within the set of possible values. An example of an ordinal design variable is the number of engines in an aircraft. A possible set of values in this case could be 2, 4, 8. A discrete variable is categorical if no order relation is known between the possible choices the variable can take. One example of a categorical variable is the color of a surface. A possible example of a set of choices could be blue, red, green. The possible choices are called the levels of the variable.</p><p>Several methods have been proposed to address the recent increase interest in mixed Kriging based models <ref type="bibr" coords="4,446.38,724.09,11.36,7.43" target="#b30">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,457.73,724.09,3.79,7.43" target="#b31">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,457.73,724.09,3.79,7.43" target="#b32">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,461.52,724.09,11.36,7.43" target="#b33">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,472.88,724.09,11.36,7.43" target="#b35">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,484.24,724.09,11.36,7.43" target="#b39">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,495.59,724.09,11.36,7.43" target="#b53">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,506.95,724.09,11.36,7.43" target="#b54">54]</ref>.

In SMT 2.0, the correlation kernel is an option that can be set to either CR (CONT_RELAX_KERNEL), GD (GOWER_KERNEL), HH (HOMO_HSPHERE_KERNEL) or EHH (EXP_HOMO_HSPHERE_KERNEL).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Mixed Gaussian processes</head><p>The continuous and ordinal variables are both treated similarly in SMT 2.0 with a continuous kernel, where the ordinal values are converted to continuous through relaxation. For categorical variables, four models (GD, CR, EHH and HH) can be used in SMT 2.0 if specified by the API. This is why we developed a unified mathematical formulation that allows a unique implementation for any model. Denote 𝑙 the number of categorical variables. For a given 𝑖 ∈ {1, … , 𝑙}, the 𝑖th categorical variable is denoted 𝑐 𝑖 and its number of levels is denoted 𝐿 𝑖 . The hyperparameter matrix peculiar to this variable 𝑐 𝑖 is</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="5,37.59,387.90,164.75,43.25">𝛩 𝑖 = ⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣ [𝛩 𝑖 ] 1,1 𝑺𝒚𝒎.

For two given inputs in the DoE, for example, the 𝑟th and 𝑠th points, let 𝑐 𝑟 𝑖 and 𝑐 𝑠 𝑖 be the associated categorical variables taking respectively the 𝓁 𝑖 𝑟 and the 𝓁 𝑖 𝑠 level on the categorical variable 𝑐 𝑖 . The categorical correlation kernel is defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="5,37.59,488.52,251.08,38.53">𝑘 𝑐𝑎𝑡 (𝑐 𝑟 , 𝑐 𝑠 , 𝜃 𝑐𝑎𝑡 ) = 𝑙 ∏ 𝑖=1 𝜅([𝛷(𝛩 𝑖 )] 𝓁 𝑟 𝑖 ,𝓁 𝑠 𝑖 ) 𝜅([𝛷(𝛩 𝑖 )] 𝓁 𝑠 𝑖 ,𝓁 𝑟 𝑖 )𝜅([𝛷(𝛩 𝑖 )] 𝓁 𝑟 𝑖 ,𝓁 𝑟 𝑖 )𝜅([𝛷(𝛩 𝑖 )] 𝓁 𝑠 𝑖 ,𝓁 𝑠 𝑖 ) (1)</formula><p>where 𝜅 is either a positive definite kernel or identity and 𝛷(.) is a symmetric positive definite (SPD) function such that the matrix 𝛷(𝛩 𝑖 ) is SPD if 𝛩 𝑖 is SPD. For an exponential kernel, Table <ref type="table" coords="5,246.35,552.36,4.49,7.43" target="#tab_3">3</ref> gives the parameterizations of 𝛷 and 𝜅 that correspond to GD, CR, HH, and EHH kernels. The complexity of these different kernels depends on the number of hyperparameters that characterizes them. As defined by Saves et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,94.53,592.85,14.36,7.43" target="#b34">[34]</ref>, for every categorical variable 𝑖 ∈ {1, … , 𝑙}, the matrix 𝐶(𝛩 𝑖 ) ∈ R 𝐿 𝑖 ×𝐿 𝑖 is lower triangular and built using a hypersphere decomposition <ref type="bibr" coords="5,93.42,613.10,15.38,7.43" target="#b55">[55,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,108.80,613.10,11.54,7.43" target="#b56">56]</ref> from the symmetric matrix 𝛩 𝑖 ∈ R 𝐿 𝑖 ×𝐿 𝑖 of hyperparameters. The variable 𝜖 is a small positive constant and the variable 𝜃 𝑖 denotes the only positive hyperparameter that is used for the Gower distance kernel.</p><p>Another Kriging based model that can use mixed variables is Kriging with partial least squares (KPLS) <ref type="bibr" coords="5,162.15,663.72,14.36,7.43" target="#b57">[57]</ref>. KPLS adapts Kriging to high dimensional problems by using a reduced number of hyperparameters thanks to a projection into a smaller space. Also, for a general surrogate, not necessarily Kriging, SMT 2.0 uses continuous relaxation to allow whatever model to handle mixed variables. For example, we can use mixed variables with least squares (LS) or quadratic polynomial (QP) models. We now illustrate the abilities of the toolbox in terms of mixed modeling over an engineering test case. </p></div>

As in Cheng et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,498.13,295.56,14.36,7.43" target="#b58">[58]</ref>, the Young modulus is 𝐸 = 200 GPa and the chosen load is 𝐹 = 50 kN. Also, as in Roustant et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,372.81,316.73,14.36,7.43" target="#b32">[32]</ref>, 12 possible cross-sections can be used.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(b).</head><p>To compare the mixed Kriging models of SMT 2.0, we draw a 98 point LHS as training set and the validation set is a grid of 12 × 30 × 30 = 10800 points. For the four implemented methods, displacement error (computed with a root-mean-square error criterion), likelihood, number of hyperparameters and computational time for every model are shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="5,379.36,401.67,3.36,7.43" target="#tab_4">4</ref>. For the continuous variables, we use the square exponential kernel. More details are found in <ref type="bibr" coords="5,476.27,412.26,14.35,7.43" target="#b34">[34]</ref>. As expected, the complex EHH and HH models lead to a lower displacement error and a higher likelihood value, but use more hyperparameters and increase the computational cost compared to GD and CR. On this test case, the kernel EHH is easier to optimize than HH but in general, they are similar in terms of performance. Also, by default SMT 2.0 uses CR as it is known to be a good trade-off between complexity and performance <ref type="bibr" coords="5,353.76,486.36,14.36,7.43" target="#b59">[59]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Surrogate models with hierarchical variables in SMT 2.0</head><p>To introduce the newly developed Kriging model for hierarchical variables implemented in SMT 2.0, we present the general mathematical framework for hierarchical and mixed variables established by Audet et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,365.85,562.84,14.36,7.43" target="#b38">[38]</ref>. In SMT 2.0, two variants of our new method are implemented, namely SMT Alg-Kernel and SMT Arc-Kernel. In particular, the SMT Alg-Kernel is a novel correlation kernel introduced in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">The hierarchical variables framework</head><p>A problem structure is classified as hierarchical when the sets of active variables depend on architectural choices. This occurs frequently in industrial design problems. In hierarchical problems, we can classify variables as neutral, meta (also known as dimensional) or decreed (also known as conditionally active) as detailed in Audet et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,539.74,681.66,14.36,7.43" target="#b38">[38]</ref>. Neutral variables are the variables that are not affected by the hierarchy whereas the value assigned to meta variables determines which decreed variables are activated. For example, a meta variable could be the number of engines. If the number of engines changes, the number of decreed bypass ratios that every engine should specify also changes.  However, the wing aspect ratio being neutral, it is not affected by this hierarchy.</p><p>Problems involving hierarchical variables are generally dependant on discrete architectures and as such involve mixed variables. Hence, in addition to their role (neutral, meta or decreed), each variable also has a variable type amongst categorical, ordinal or continuous. For the sake of simplicity and because both continuous and ordinal variables are treated similarly <ref type="bibr" coords="6,115.60,544.65,14.36,7.43" target="#b34">[34]</ref>, we chose to regroup them as quantitative variables. For instance, the neutral variables 𝑥 neu may be partitioned into different variable types, such that 𝑥 neu = (𝑥 cat neu , 𝑥 The variable classification scheme in SMT 2.0 is detailed in Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="6,271.66,585.72,3.36,7.43" target="#fig_3">3</ref>.</p><p>To explain the framework and the new Kriging model, we illustrate the inputs variables of the model using a classical machine learning problem related to the hyperparameters optimization of a fullyconnected Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) <ref type="bibr" coords="6,187.85,626.37,15.72,7.43" target="#b38">[38]</ref> on Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="6,235.42,626.37,3.36,7.43" target="#fig_6">4</ref>. In Table <ref type="table" coords="6,281.95,626.37,3.36,7.43" target="#tab_5">5</ref>, we detail the input variables of the model related to the MLP problem (i.e., the hyperparameters of the neural network, together with their types and roles). To keep things clear and concise, the chosen problem is a simplification of the original problem developed by Audet et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="6,37.59,677.18,14.36,7.43" target="#b38">[38]</ref>. Regarding the MLP problem of Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="6,191.64,677.18,4.49,7.43" target="#fig_6">4</ref> and following the classification scheme of Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="6,124.57,687.35,3.36,7.43" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, we start by separating the input variables according to their role.

A classic approach, called the imputation method (Imp-Kernel) leads to an efficient paradigm in practice that can be easily integrated into a more general framework as proposed by Bussemaker et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="7,539.74,492.51,14.36,7.43" target="#b24">[24]</ref>. However, this kernel lacks depth and depends on arbitrary choices. Therefore, Hutter and Osborne <ref type="bibr" coords="7,425.76,513.51,15.72,7.43" target="#b21">[21]</ref> also proposed a more general kernel, called Arc-Kernel and Horn et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="7,479.69,524.00,15.71,7.43" target="#b36">[36]</ref> generalized this kernel even more and proposed a new formulation called the Wedge-Kernel <ref type="bibr" coords="7,339.70,545.00,14.36,7.43" target="#b37">[37]</ref>. The drawbacks of these two methods are that they add some extra hyperparameters for every decreed dimension (respectively one extra hyperparameter for the Arc-Kernel and two hyperparameters for the Wedge-Kernel) and that they need a normalization according to the bounds. More recently, Pelamatti et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="7,503.80,587.00,15.72,7.43" target="#b60">[60]</ref> developed a hierarchical kernel for Bayesian optimization. However, our work is also more general thanks to the framework introduced earlier <ref type="bibr" coords="7,541.97,607.99,15.72,7.43" target="#b38">[38]</ref> that considers variable-wise formulation and is more flexible as we are allowing sub-problems to be intersecting.</p><p>In the following, we describe our new method to build a correlation kernel for hierarchical variables. In particular, we introduce a new algebraic kernel called Alg-Kernel that behaves like the Arc-Kernel whilst correcting most of its drawbacks. In particular, our kernel does not add any hyperparameters, and the normalization is handled in a natural way.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">A neural network test-case using SMT 2.0</head><p>In this section, we apply our models to the hyperparameters optimization of a MLP problem aforementioned of Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="9,220.11,440.83,3.36,7.43" target="#fig_6">4</ref>. Within SMT 2.0 an example illustrates this MLP problem. For the sake of showing the Kriging surrogate abilities, we implemented a dummy function with no significance to replace the real black-box that would require training a whole Neural Network (NN) with big data. This function requires a number of variables that depends on the value of the meta variable, i.e the number of hidden layers. To simplify, we have chosen only 1, 2 or 3 hidden layers and therefore, we have 3 decreed variables but deep neural networks could also be investigated as our model can tackle a few dozen variables. A test case <ref type="bibr" coords="9,183.14,534.97,105.53,7.43">(test_hierarchical_variables_NN )</ref> shows that our model SMT Alg-Kernel interpolates the data properly, checks that the data dimension is correct and also asserts that the inactive decreed variables have no influence over the prediction. In Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="9,62.72,576.82,4.49,7.43" target="#fig_5">5</ref> we illustrate the usage of Kriging surrogates with hierarchical and mixed variables based on the implementation of SMT 2.0 for test_hierarchical_variables_NN.</p><p>To compare the hierarchical models of SMT 2.0 (SMT Alg-Kernel and SMT Arc-Kernel) with the state-of-the-art imputation method previously used on industrial application (Imp-Kernel) <ref type="bibr" coords="9,256.09,629.98,14.36,7.43" target="#b24">[24]</ref>, we draw a 99 point LHS (33 points by meta level) as a training set and the validation set is a LHS of 3 × 1000 = 3000 points. For the Imp-Kernel, the decreed-excluded values are replaced by 52 because the mean value 52.5 is not an integer (by default, SMT rounds to the floor value).</p><p>For the three methods, the precision (computed with a root-meansquare error RMSE criterion), the likelihood and the computational time are shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="9,124.14,703.21,3.36,7.43" target="#tab_6">6</ref>. For this problem, we can see that SMT Algkernel gives better performance than the imputation method or SMT Arc-kernel. Also, as all methods use the same number of hyperparameters, they have similar time performances. A direct application of our modeling method is Bayesian optimization to perform quickly the hyperparameter optimization of a neural network <ref type="bibr" coords="9,486.32,159.49,14.35,7.43" target="#b63">[63]</ref>.</p></div>

The first four criteria (center, maximin, centermaximin, correlation) are the same as in pyDOE. <ref type="bibr" coords="12,333.53,444.52,5.61,4.64" target="#b12">12</ref> The last criterion ese, is implemented by the authors of SMT <ref type="bibr" coords="12,326.60,455.66,14.36,7.43" target="#b48">[48]</ref>. In SMT 2.0 a new LHS method was developed for the Nested design of experiments (NestedLHS) <ref type="bibr" coords="12,472.09,466.12,15.72,7.43" target="#b74">[73]</ref> to use with multifidelity surrogates.

Moreover, we proposed a sampling method for mixed variables, and the aforementioned LHS method was applied to hierarchical variables in Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="12,495.16,518.42,3.36,7.43" target="#fig_10">8</ref>.</p></div>

Kriging surrogates are based on hyperparameters and on a correlation kernel. Four correlation kernels are now implemented in SMT 2.0 <ref type="bibr" coords="12,485.10,588.69,14.36,7.43" target="#b75">[74]</ref>. In SMT, these correlation functions are absolute exponential (abs_exp), Gaussian (squar_exp), Matern 5/2 (matern52) and Matern 3/2 (matern32). In addition, the implementation of gradient and Hessian for each kernel makes it possible to calculate both the first and second derivatives of the GP likelihood with respect to the hyperparameters <ref type="bibr" coords="12,503.38,641.00,10.09,7.43" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>Variance derivatives for Kriging. To perform uncertainty quantification for system analysis purposes, it could be interesting to know more about the variance derivatives of a model <ref type="bibr" coords="12,462.89,679.04,11.59,7.43" target="#b76">[75]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="12,474.48,679.04,3.86,7.43" target="#b77">[76]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="12,478.34,679.04,11.59,7.43" target="#b78">[77]</ref>. For that purpose and also to pursue the original publication about derivatives <ref type="bibr" coords="12,526.30,689.50,10.09,7.43" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, SMT 2.0 extends the derivative support to Kriging variances and kernels. Noisy Kriging. In engineering and in big data contexts with real experiments, surrogate models for noisy data are of significant interest. In particular, there is a growing need for techniques like noisy Kriging and noisy Multi-Fidelity Kriging (MFK) for data fusion <ref type="bibr" coords="13,238.52,87.43,14.36,7.43" target="#b79">[78]</ref>. For that purpose, SMT 2.0 has been designed to accommodate Kriging and MFK to noisy data including the option to incorporate heteroscedastic noise (using the use_het_noise option) and to account for different noise levels for each data source <ref type="bibr" coords="13,135.20,129.27,14.36,7.43" target="#b40">[40]</ref>.</p><p>Kriging with partial least squares. Beside MGP, for high-dimensional problems, the toolbox implements Kriging with partial least squares (KPLS) <ref type="bibr" coords="13,65.83,166.83,15.72,7.43" target="#b57">[57]</ref> and its extension KPLSK <ref type="bibr" coords="13,180.43,166.83,14.36,7.43" target="#b44">[44]</ref>. The PLS information is computed by projecting the data into a smaller space spanned by the principal components. By integrating this PLS information into the Kriging correlation matrix, the number of inputs can be scaled down, thereby reducing the number of hyperparameters required. The resulting number of hyperparameters 𝑑 𝑒 is indeed much smaller than the original problem dimension 𝑑. Recently, in SMT 2.0, we extended the KPLS method for multi-fidelity Kriging (MFKPLS and MFKPLSK) <ref type="bibr" coords="13,262.89,240.05,14.73,7.43" target="#b74">[73,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="13,277.62,240.05,11.05,7.43" target="#b80">79,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="13,37.59,250.51,10.93,7.43" target="#b81">80]</ref>. We also proposed an automatic criterion to choose automatically the reduced dimension 𝑑 𝑒 based on Wold's R criterion <ref type="bibr" coords="13,251.09,260.97,14.36,7.43" target="#b82">[81]</ref>. This criterion has been applied to aircraft optimization with EGO where the number 𝑑 𝑒 (𝚗_𝚌𝚘𝚖𝚙 in the code) for the model is automatically selected at every iteration <ref type="bibr" coords="13,100.10,292.35,14.36,7.43" target="#b39">[39]</ref>. Special efforts have been made to accommodate KPLS for multi-fidelity and mixed integer data <ref type="bibr" coords="13,205.60,302.82,14.57,7.43" target="#b80">[79,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="13,220.17,302.82,10.93,7.43" target="#b81">80]</ref>.</p><p>Marginal Gaussian process. SMT 2.0 implements Marginal Gaussian Process (MGP) surrogate models for high dimensional problems <ref type="bibr" coords="13,270.72,329.90,14.36,7.43" target="#b83">[82]</ref>. MGP are Gaussian processes taking into account hyperparameters uncertainty defined as a density probability function. Especially we suppose that the function to model 𝑓 ∶ 𝛺 ↦ R, where 𝛺 ⊂ R 𝑑 and 𝑑 is the number of design variables, lies in a linear embedding  such as  = {𝑢 = 𝐴𝑥, 𝑥 ∈ 𝛺}, 𝐴 ∈ R 𝑑×𝑑 𝑒 and 𝑓 (𝑥) = 𝑓  (𝐴𝑥) with 𝑓 (𝑥) = 𝑓  ∶  ↦ R and 𝑑 𝑒 ≪ 𝑑. Then, we must use a kernel 𝑘(𝑥, 𝑥 ′ ) = 𝑘  (𝐴𝑥, 𝐴𝑥 ′ ) whose each component of the transfer matrix 𝐴 is an hyperparameter. Thus we have 𝑑 𝑒 × 𝑑 hyperparameters to find. Note that 𝑑 𝑒 is defined as 𝚗_𝚌𝚘𝚖𝚙 in the code <ref type="bibr" coords="13,116.27,424.05,14.36,7.43" target="#b49">[49]</ref>.</p><p>Gradient-enhanced neural network. The new release SMT 2.0 implements Gradient-Enhanced Neural Network (GENN) models <ref type="bibr" coords="13,270.73,451.14,14.36,7.43" target="#b45">[45]</ref>. Gradient-Enhanced Neural Networks (GENN) are fully connected multilayer perceptrons whose training process was modified to account for gradient information. Specifically, the model is trained to minimize not only the prediction error of the response but also the prediction error of the partial derivatives: the chief benefit of gradient enhancement is better accuracy with fewer training points. Note that GENN applies to regression (single-output or multi-output), but not classification since there is no gradient in that case. The implementation is fully vectorized and uses ADAM optimization, mini-batch, and L2-norm regularization. For example, GENN can be used to learn airfoil geometries from a database. This usage is documented in SMT 2.0.<ref type="foot" coords="13,212.60,565.53,5.61,4.64" target="#foot_6">13</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Contributions to Applications</head><p>Kriging trajectory and sampling. Sampling a GP with high resolution is usually expensive due to the large dimension of the associated covariance matrix. Several methods are proposed to draw samples of a GP on a given set of points. To sample a conditioned GP, the classic method consists in using a Cholesky decomposition (or eigendecomposition) of the conditioned covariance matrix of the process but some numerical computational errors can lead to non SPD matrix. A more recent approach based on Karhunen-Loève decomposition of the covariance kernel with the Nyström method has been proposed in <ref type="bibr" coords="13,272.95,693.84,15.72,7.43" target="#b84">[83]</ref> where the paths can be sampled by generating independent standard Normal distributed samples.

A parallel criterion called qEI <ref type="bibr" coords="13,474.15,114.63,15.72,7.43" target="#b86">[85]</ref> was developed to perform Efficient Global Optimization (EGO): the goal is to be able to run batch optimization. At each iteration of the algorithm, multiple new sampling points are extracted from the known ones. These new sampling points are then evaluated using a parallel computing environment. Five criteria are implemented in SMT 2.0: Kriging Believer (KB), Kriging Believer Upper Bound (KBUB), Kriging Believer Lower Bound (KBLB), Kriging Believer Random Bound (KBRand) and Constant Liar (CLmin) <ref type="bibr" coords="13,338.03,198.31,14.36,7.43" target="#b87">[86]</ref>.</p></div>
