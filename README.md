# Scientific-Articles-Scraping
This repository showcases my contributions to the IGL (Introduction to General Linguistics) term project, focusing on the extraction of information from scientific articles in PDF format. The task was accomplished through three distinct methods, each providing a unique approach to achieve the desired results.
Methods:

- Grobid Extraction:

Leveraging the power of Grobid, a robust tool for extracting and parsing information from PDF documents, this method ensures accurate retrieval of structured data from scientific articles.
- ChatPDF Extraction:

Implementation of the ChatPDF extraction method, offering an alternative approach to gather information from PDFs. This method explores innovative techniques to enhance the accuracy of data extraction.
- Regular Expressions:

Utilizing regular expressions, this method demonstrates a lightweight yet effective way to extract information from PDF documents. This approach might be particularly useful for scenarios where more specialized tools are not readily available or applicable.
Accuracy Achieved:

Among the methods employed, the Grobid extraction method has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving an impressive 88% accuracy in extracting relevant information from scientific articles.
